Officials believe the suspects acted alone.US media have reported that one of the suspects had made anti-Semitic and anti-police social media posts online before the attack.At least one of the suspects appeared to be interested in a group called the Black Hebrew Israelites, whose believers say they are the true descendents of ancient Israelites, officials said. The group is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group.But Mr Grewal said no official link with the group had been established.Earlier Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop tweeted that \"hate and anti-Semitism\" had no place in the city.\"I think as more info comes out it will be more and more clear not only that this was a hate crime but that the perpetrators had hoped to kill many more people than four,\" he said. The violence began at a cemetery about one mile (1.6km) away from the grocery store. The pair killed Detective Joseph Seals, 39, who approached them for questioning about the murder of an Uber driver over the weekend, investigators said.Thy fled the scene in the van and drove to the kosher supermarket at 12:20 local time (17:20 GMT) where they held off armed police and federal officials for four hours, shooting off hundreds of rounds of ammunition.The attackers had opened fire on the shop before entering, alerting two officers on foot patrol who began firing at the suspects until they were injured by the attackers' gunfire.Mr Fulop told reporters that street cameras showed two people \"slowly\" drive towards the market, then \"calmly open the door with two long rifles and begin firing from the street\" into the shop.The incident ended just before 16:00 when officials used an armoured vehicle to ram through the front entrance of the shop and found the bodies of the attackers.The attack put approximately 30,000 students on lockdown, unable to leave their classrooms for hours after the school day had ended. The three victims inside the shop were killed soon after the gunfire broke out, but one managed to escape after being injured.They have been identified by New Jersey officials as Mindy Ferencz, 32; Miguel Douglas, 49; and Moshe Deutch, 24.\"Mindel Ferencz, may she rest in peace, was a pioneer,\" said Rabbi David Niederman, who first confirmed the death of the mother of five.\"She was a lady full of love for others,\" he added. \"Unfortunately, her life was cut so short.\"Ferencz's mother told the New York Times that her husband, who owned the supermarket, had taken a break from work to go to a nearby synagogue minutes before shots rang out.Deutsch's death was also confirmed by Rabbi Niederman, who hailed him as a student who had worked to organise a food drive that provided help to 2,000 families each year.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attack a \"hate crime\" and an \"act of terror\", and ordered police to be on high alert, especially in Jewish communities. Jersey City is part of the New York metropolitan area.\"This confirms a sad truth. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism gripping this nation. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism in this city,\" he said in a Wednesday news conference.He added: \"History tells us to take these warning signs seriously.\"New York Police Department commissioner Dermot Shea added that hate crimes in New York City were up 22% this year.\"You see a swastika being drawn, you see a brick being thrown through a window, you see a woman walking down the street with her kids and having her wig ripped off,\" he said."}
