Wage growth, while still modest, also ticked up, rising 3.1% year-on-year.The White House welcomed the gains, which officials said proved President Donald Trump's economic policies were working.\"Great jobs report!\" Mr Trump tweeted. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the jobs numbers were \"astonishing\", but could be revised down at some point.The 266,000 rise was \"well above\" the analyst consensus of 180,000, and considering returning GM workers were part of a net gain of 41,000 in the motor industry, the numbers were \"hugely strong\", he said.\"This is wild,\" he said. \"That [jump is] hard to square with leading indicators, all of which tanked in the late summer and early fall, so it seems like a candidate for a big downward revision.\"The US economy, which is powered largely by consumer spending, grew at an annualised rate of 2.1% in the three months to 30 September, according to the latest government estimate.But business investment and confidence have slumped, amid concerns about trade fights and global growth. The rate of hiring has also retreated, dipping from an average of 223,000 per month in 2018 to 180,000 per month this year.To address fears of a slowdown, the US central bank has lowered interest rates three times since July.The strength of the latest hiring report suggests the Federal Reserve will leave rates untouched for now, analysts said."}
