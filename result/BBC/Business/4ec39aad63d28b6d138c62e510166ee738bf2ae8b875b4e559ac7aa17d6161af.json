According to the British Film Institute (BFI), UK films grossed $9.4bn (\u00a37.2bn) in 2018, a 23% share of the global box office take.There is a long history of film making at Elstree. The existing studios, in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, date back to 1925, and were used by George Lucas when he filmed the original Star Wars trilogy.The new Sky studies will be located close by on land owned by Legal and General, which will fund the development and lease the studios back to Sky.The studios, which will cost hundreds of millions of pounds to build, will have 14 sound stages.Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal and General, said the plans were \"another development in the modernisation of British industry\".Over the last five years Legal and General has made \u00a320bn of investments in similar projects."}
