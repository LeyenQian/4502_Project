Saudi banks also offered citizens cheap credit to buy the shares following a nationwide advertising campaign.The share sale is at the heart of plans to modernise the Saudi economy and wean it off its dependence on oil.The kingdom urgently needs tens of billions of dollars to fund megaprojects and develop new industries.Analysis:  Sameer Hashmi,  BBC Middle East Business CorrespondentIt was widely expected that Saudi Aramco shares would get off to a blistering start - thanks to the strong backing of local affluent investors and Saudi institutions - who were asked to buy shares at the start of trading. Friendly gulf neighbours like the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have also helped bolster the share sale by pumping in billions of dollars. The Kingdom's energy minister is confident that the company's valuation would breach the $2 trillion mark in the coming days. Analysts expect the share price to remain firm in the near future but also say that the real test would be to sustain the momentum in the long run.The IPO is at the heart of Saudi Arabia's ambitious plans to diversify its economy away from oil. The Kingdom's crown prince - Muhammed bin Salman (MbS), who is spearheading the economic strategy - wants to use the IPO proceeds to part-fund some key initiatives announced under a programme called 'Vision 2030' that aims to modernise Saudi Arabia's economy by investing in new industries and multi-billion dollar projects.
