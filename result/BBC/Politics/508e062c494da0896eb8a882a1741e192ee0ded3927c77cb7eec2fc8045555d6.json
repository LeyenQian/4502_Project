The promises to look after victims who then face months of delay for mental health support or years of waiting for compensation.\"We ask all of the parties to agree to consult on and implement a new 'Survivors' Charter' that would guarantee basic rights and services for survivors.\"The group wants MPs to back \"Martyn's Law\", compelling all owners of events spaces to have in place a \"basic security plan\". This is named after Martyn Hett, killed in the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017, in which 22 people were killed.The group says it is \"sick of promises that never materialise\" but praises the \"heroes\" who confronted Khan on London Bridge, preventing him from continuing his attack.It also asks the public not to \"give the terrorists what they want by sharing videos or views from attackers or by blaming whole groups or giving in to hate\".And it wants the media to \"allow survivors the space to recover after terrorist incidents and to focus coverage on the heroes rather than the attackers\".Three people were injured in Friday's attack, which Khan began at a prisoner rehabilitation conference, organised by Cambridge University, at Fishmongers' Hall, next to London Bridge.Two of the injured remain in hospital and are described as being in a stable condition."}
