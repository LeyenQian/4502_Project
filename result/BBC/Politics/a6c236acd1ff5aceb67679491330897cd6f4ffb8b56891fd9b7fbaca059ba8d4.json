So why is he refusing to suspend these three candidates, none of whom appear to have apologised?\"Johnson has never called out and condemned anti-Semitic Soros narratives among his supporters.\"On the contrary, the Conservatives whipped their MEPs to vote in support of the Hungarian government which peddles the Soros conspiracy and appointed a senior government adviser who promotes this narrative.\"Mr Gwynne added: \"Anti-Semitism is clearly rife in the Conservative Party from top to bottom.\"Johnson must answer for the anti-Semitism being promoted in his name.\"Jewish multi-billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who has given away \u00a332bn, has been the topic of numerous fake news stories and conspiracy theories, many of which are anti-Semitic.Under electoral law, if a candidate is suspended after nominations close, they will still appear on the ballot paper and affiliated to that party. Mr Johnson has previously apologised for the \"hurt and offence\" that has been caused by Islamophobia in the Tory Party.Meanwhile, Labour has been beset by allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, leading to the suspension of a number of high-profile figures such as Ken Livingstone and Chris Williamson, and an unprecedented investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Mr Corbyn has apologised for incidents of anti-Semitism in Labour on several occasions and said anti-Jewish racism was \"vile and wrong\"."}
