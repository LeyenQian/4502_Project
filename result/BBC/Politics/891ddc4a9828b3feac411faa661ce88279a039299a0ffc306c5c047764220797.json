However, Mr Johnson described that claim as \"Bermuda Triangle stuff\".Responding to the performances of Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \"That was utterly woeful. Two uninspiring men, both of them unsuited to be PM.\" Meanwhile, Amelia Womack, of the Green Party, told the BBC: \"I find it frustrating, as a younger woman, that we weren't discussing things that are relevant to my generation - whether that's house prices, rental prices, freedom of movement across Europe, or even zero-hour contracts.\"Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said the debate felt like a \"shoddy end-of-term pantomime\", and said both men displayed a \"lack of honesty\". She added that, contrary to the claims of Mr Johnson, the \"chaos\" of Brexit \"is going to go on\", even if the UK leaves the EU next month.And the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: \"Tonight's debate was British politics at its worst. Two leaders offering nothing new, nothing different and neither being honest about the pain Brexit will cause our communities.\"The prime minister and Mr Corbyn were also asked about security - an issue that has risen to prominence since the London Bridge attack on 29 November.Both candidates were asked by an audience member if they would prioritise the safety of citizens over human rights.Mr Corbyn said the choice was \"not an either/or\". He added the UK could not have security \"on the cheap\", and so Labour would \"back the police up\" with an increase in officer numbers.When it came to his turn, Mr Johnson referred to the London Bridge attack, and said it was \"extraordinary and wrong\" that the attacker was given automatic early release from prison after an earlier terrorism conviction.In a campaign where both parties have sought to repeatedly talk about their key themes, tonight did not diverge radically from the script.Boris Johnson came under pressure on the issue of trust - and whether his Brexit plan would mean checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn was once again pressed on his failure to pick a side on Brexit - and questioned on why Europe would offer Labour a new deal when so many frontbenchers back Remain.Both men landed punches. But none of them were critical. And given that polls suggest the Conservatives are ahead in the polls - that might suit Boris Johnson more than Jeremy Corbyn. Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. "}
