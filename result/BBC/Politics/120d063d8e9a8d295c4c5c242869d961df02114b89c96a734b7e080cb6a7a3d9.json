If the exit poll results are borne out the Conservative Party will not require the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to help it achieve a working majority.The DUP propped up Theresa May's minority administration for two years following the 2017 general election.But the party's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said as Mr Johnson sought a trade deal with the EU there would still be opportunities for the DUP to influence proceedings.Sinn F\u00e9in's Alex Maskey said if the exit poll proved accurate it would take the \"dead hand\" of the Tory-DUP relationship away from the political process in Northern Ireland.He predicted it would make it more likely that the DUP would do a deal with his party to restore devolved government.The power-sharing executive at Stormont collapsed in January 2017 after a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in over a flawed green energy scheme.Fresh talks aimed at restoring the executive are due to start on Monday.Meanwhile Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken said if the exit poll is correct Northern Ireland is in for a \"world of hurt\" with Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.The Alliance Party will be thinking their decision to stand candidates in all 18 constituencies- and not get involved in a pro-remain pact - has paid off.Not only have they taken North Down with Stephen Farry's win, but in East Antrim and Lagan Valley - two DUP strongholds - they are running a closer race than expected and the DUP vote looks to be down.\"A very good night,\" an Alliance source tells me, also indicating they could be playing for third spot in South Down.Alliance went into this election hoping to re-take East Belfast but are now hopeful for entirely different reasons.They are privately conceding they are unlikely to defeat DUP's Gavin Robinson, but I'm also hearing it will be closer this time than two years ago.Voters faced some wet and windy weather, but turnout was said to be high in many places."}
