Democratic leadership sources say they could lose more than at least two moderate Democrats on the impeachment votes, but there's no concern about major defections that could endanger the articles.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she is not lobbying moderates on the fence to vote for impeachment.\"People have to come to their own conclusions,\" Pelosi said.The speaker said the facts are clear, and she isn't concerned about losing more Democrats on the articles of impeachment than the two who voted against the resolution establishing procedures for the inquiry. \"People will vote the way they vote,\" she said.While the White House did not participate in the House impeachment proceedings, Trump weighed in on the debate Thursday, tweeting that two Democrats were misconstruing his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the US President he asked for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\"Dems Veronica Escobar and Jackson Lee purposely misquoted my call,\" Trump said. \"I said I want you to do us (our Country!) a favor, not me a favor. They know that but decided to LIE in order to make a fraudulent point! Very sad.\"But the White House is preparing for the proceedings to move to the Senate. White House counsel Pat Cipollone and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland huddled Thursday in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office.\"We are having a lot of good conversations with Senate Republicans,\" Ueland said after the meeting. \"We will continue to do that here over the next few days and weeks as we work through all these issues and priorities the President has outlined when it comes to where we should go on these articles, which starts with defeating them in the House because they are not based on the facts.\"House Republican leaders, meanwhile, are lobbying their members on the House floor to oppose impeachment, as Republicans work to keep the number of GOP defections on impeachment at zero. A free-wheeling committee debateThursday's debate was free-wheeling, as any committee member was able to offer an amendment to the impeachment articles and every lawmaker could speak up to debate it.The first Republican amendment, introduced by GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, simply removed the first impeachment article from the resolution. It was defeated in a party-line vote.\"Article one in this resolution ignores the truth, ignores the facts, it ignores what happened and what has been laid out for the American people over the last three weeks,\" Jordan said.Democrats responded that Republicans were ignoring the President's misconduct, continuing the partisan debate over impeachment that began on Wednesday night when every lawmaker on the 41-member committee delivered an opening statement.\"The President committed the highest crime against the Constitution by abusing his office,\" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. \"Cheating in an election, inviting foreign interference for a purely personal gain while jeopardizing our national security and the integrity of our elections.\"Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida offered the second Republican amendment to replace Joe Biden's name in the impeachment resolution with the \"well-known corrupt company, Burisma,\" and Hunter Biden, saying that Hunter Biden's appointment to the Ukrainian energy company \"looks dirty as it is.\" The amendment was also defeated along party lines.Explaining the resolution, Gaetz walked through Hunter Biden's substance abuse problems, which drew a sharp rebuke from Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia. \"I would say that the pot calling the kettle black is not something that we should do,\" Johnson said.He then alluded to Gaetz's past DUI arrest, without mentioning him by name: \"I don't know what members, if any, have had any problems with substance abuse, been busted in DUI, I don't know,\" Johnson said. \"But if I did, I wouldn't raise it against anyone on this committee.\"Gaetz was arrested for driving under the influence in 2008, but the charges were later dismissed. He said he was \"focused on the President\" and didn't think the public was \"hanging on a traffic incident I had a decade ago.\"The impeachment debate even veered back two decades, as two lawmakers who were on the Judiciary Committee when President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 debated the merits of that case compared to the current impeachment proceedings.\"I would just like to note that the argument that somehow, lying about a sexual affair is an abuse of presidential power, but the misuse of presidential power to get a benefit somehow doesn't matter -- if it's lying about sex, we could put Stormy Daniels' case ahead of us,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who was also a congressional staffer during the impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon. \"We don't believe that's a high crime and misdemeanor.\"Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican who was an impeachment manager in 1998, argued there was a clear crime in the Clinton impeachment.\"The important thing is, is that Bill Clinton lied to a grand jury. That is a crime,\" Sensenbrenner said. \"The article of impeachment that passed the House accused Bill Clinton of lying to a grand jury, a crime, and something that obstructs the ability of the courts to get to the truth. This is not what is happening here. Big difference.\"Republicans' efforts to change the text of the impeachment articles or block them entirely were ultimately futile, thanks to the Democrats' 23-17 advantage in the committee. But for each amendment, every member had the opportunity to speak for five minutes -- meaning Republicans could extend the committee meeting as long as they wanted to keep talking.\"If we have to fact check you all night, we will,\" Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said Thursday afternoon, saying he wasn't concerned about the congressional ball at the White House taking place Thursday evening.Republicans also detailed their process complaints about the impeachment proceedings. Collins demanded House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler agree to hold a Republican hearing day before moving forward, but his objection was defeated along party lines.\"This committee has become nothing but a rubber stamp,\" Collins said. \"This committee is amazingly now on such a clock and calendar process that they don't care -- facts be damned.\"Committee vote sets up House to impeach Trump next weekHouse Democratic leaders have not said yet when the impeachment articles will go to the floor, but a vote is expected next week, along with votes to fund the government and hand the President a significant win by approving the new US trade deal.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the path forward  on the House floor would be announced later Thursday.When the impeachment resolution comes to the floor, the House will take separate votes on each article of impeachment. Two Democratic leadership sources say it's possible they could lose more than two Democrats \u2014 the number who voted against the procedural vote on the impeachment inquiry in October \u2014 when the floor vote takes place.Those two Democrats, Reps. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Colin Peterson of Minnesota, have already said they will vote against the impeachment articles. At the same time, Democrats are likely to pick up independent Justin Amash of Michigan.But the sources acknowledge they could lose a handful more from swing districts on either or both articles. Many vulnerable members are not saying what they'll do yet, as they head back to their districts this weekend and get feedback from voters.Democrats are not expecting mass defections and they expect to have more than enough votes for final passage.Two other Democratic leadership sources say they are not planning to whip their members on the floor vote on the articles, meaning they won't twist arms to keep Democrats in line. That is intended to back up what Pelosi has been saying throughout the impeachment proceedings: The vote will be a \"vote of conscience.\"This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday."}
