That call came roughly six minutes after he had gotten off the phone with then-candidate Trump on a day when he also spoke with Rick Gates, then a campaign adviser to Trump. The evidence at trial did not definitively establish that the -1 calls were coming from any one person, including Trump.The phone number was listed in phone records released by Democrats as a part of the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment inquiry report, released Tuesday, but the report does not establish who the number belongs to.The phone records, which are labeled in the report's endnotes as coming from AT&T, show a web of communications between journalist John Solomon, Giuliani, Ukrainian American businessman Lev Parnas, House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes of California and the White House's budget office. CNN is owned by AT&T.Many of the calls occurred in April, according to the Democratic report, the same time Solomon pumped out columns in The Hill. The stories were filled with discredited conspiracy theories about then-US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and former Vice President Joe Biden, whose son was on the board of a prominent Ukrainian energy company."}
