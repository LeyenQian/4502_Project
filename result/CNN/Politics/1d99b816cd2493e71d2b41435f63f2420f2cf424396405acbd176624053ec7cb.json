{"Title": "Michael Bloomberg releases letter from doctor that says he is in 'outstanding health'", "Link": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/michael-bloomberg-health-letter/index.html", "Article": "The Democratic candidate underwent a coronary stent placement in 2000 for a blocked artery, according to the letter, signed by Dr. Stephen D. Sisson, a professor of medicine with Johns Hopkins University.  Bloomberg has had annual cardiac stress testing since the stent placement, and his 2019 test was \"normal and demonstrated excellent exercise tolerance,\" the letter says. The former mayor is on a blood thinner after developing atrial fibrillation in the setting of otherwise normal heart function in 2018, according to the letter. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heartbeat. It can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. According to the American Heart Association, at least 2.7 million Americans are living with atrial fibrillation, and the most common treatment is medication.The letter notes Bloomberg takes blood thinners, beta-blockers and cholesterol medication, but does not note specific medications or dosages. All these medications are commonly prescribed to manage heart conditions and cholesterol.\"Mr. Bloomberg is a 77-year-old man in outstanding health. There are no medical concerns, present or looming, that would prevent him from serving as President of the United States,\" the letter reads. Bloomberg is 5 feet 7 inches tall and 165 pounds with \"a muscular body mass index of 25.8kg/m2,\" according to the letter. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight, according to the National Institutes of Health. BMI is determined by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.Bloomberg doesn't smoke and does not have a history of substance use disorder or unhealthy alcohol use, the letter says. \"His diet and health habits are excellent,\" the letter reads. The campaign's letter summarized Bloomberg's health, though it did not include medical records. Last week, Elizabeth Warren's campaign released its own letter, along with results of the senator's most recent annual physical exam.Bloomberg announced a late-entry presidential bid last month aimed squarely at defeating President Donald Trump. His pitch to voters is that Trump is more likely to get reelected if Bloomberg doesn't run, suggesting none of the other Democratic contenders can beat Trump. "}
