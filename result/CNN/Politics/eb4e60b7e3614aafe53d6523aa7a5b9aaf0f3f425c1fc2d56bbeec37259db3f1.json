The Constitution details only one remedy for this misconduct: impeachment. The safety and security of our nation, our democracy, and future generations hang in the balance if we do not address this misconduct. In America, no one is above the law, not even the President.\"The report is an update to the Judiciary Committee reports that were issued in 1974 and 1998 during the impeachment proceedings of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\"The earlier reports remain useful points of reference, but no longer reflect the best available learning on questions relating to presidential impeachment,\" Nadler wrote in a forward introducing the report. \"Further, they do not address several issues of constitutional law with particular relevance to the ongoing impeachment inquiry respecting President Donald J.
