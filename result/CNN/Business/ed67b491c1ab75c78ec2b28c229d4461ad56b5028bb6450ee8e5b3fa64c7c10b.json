CNN's sister network HLN has reached out to Burger King for a response to the allegations in the lawsuit but has not yet heard back.Burger King's website describes the Impossible Whopper as \"100% Whopper, 0% Beef.\"\"For guests looking for a meat-free option, a non-broiler method of preparation is available upon request,\" the site notes.Phillip Williams, the plaintiff in the case, is a vegan who does not eat or drink anything that uses animal by-products.He purchased an Impossible Whopper at a location in Atlanta in August after seeing advertisements and paid \"premium price\" for the meatless option, according to the lawsuit.The lawsuit alleges that if he had known the burger would be cooked in such a manner, he would have not purchased it.The Burger King that Williams visited did not have signage at the drive-thru indicating that the plant-based burger would be cooked on the same grill as meat, the suit says. Williams \"suffered monetary damages in the amount that he paid to purchase\" the Impossible Whopper, according to the suit.The lawsuit indicates that several other consumers have made similar complaints online about the chain's practice surrounding the sale of the Impossible Whopper.The Impossible Whopper has been deemed a huge success for Burger King, fueling its best quarter in four years, according to Restaurant Bands (QSR)."}
