Saudi Aramco briefly became the world's first $2 trillion company on Thursday, as its shares gained 10% for a second consecutive day in Riyadh. Sustaining production cutsSaudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer by far, has been doing much of the heavy lifting to curtail supply since the group began limiting production in 2017. But prices have languished around $60 a barrel, prompting the producer group to act again. Last week, OPEC and its allies agreed to cut oil production by an additional 500,000 barrels per day from January 1, bringing total output reductions to 1.7 million barrels daily. UBS analysts expect the deal to be extended beyond its current expiration date in March. Rolling it over to the rest of 2020 could address the supply surplus, but continued uncertainty over factors including surging US shale production are likely to keep Brent prices below $70 dollars per barrel, UBS said.Production cuts that are too deep or too long risk reigniting non-OPEC investment, especially from the United States, perpetuating market instability, UBS said. US oil production has more than doubled over the past decade, driven by the boom in shale production.The United States was a net oil exporter for the first time in decades in September, the International Energy Agency said. That could become commonplace starting late next year or in early 2021, it added. "}
