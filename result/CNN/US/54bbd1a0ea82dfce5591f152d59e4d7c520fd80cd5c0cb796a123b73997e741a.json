The bacterium is resistant to extreme hot and extreme cold situations. It can cause sometimes fatal infections in those who are frail, elderly or young children with weaker immune systems, the FDA says.Healthy individuals may experience high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. And in pregnant women, the microbe is known to cause miscarriages and stillbirths, according to the FDA.About 1,600 people in the US become seriously ill from listeria each year, and about 16% of the cases prove fatal.To protect yourself, public health officials say to cook all meat to temperatures recommended by US Department of Agriculture and to wash all vegetables and fruit."}
