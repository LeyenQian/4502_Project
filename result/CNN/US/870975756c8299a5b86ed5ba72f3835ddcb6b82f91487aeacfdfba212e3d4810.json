A homeless man, Johnny Bobbitt Jr., supposedly saw her and gave her his last $20 for gas. McClure and D'Amico, her then-boyfriend, posted about the \"good deed\" on social media and started a GoFundMe to raise money for him. But the story was not true and unraveled after more than $400,000 had been contributed by more than 14,000 people through GoFundMe.Prosecutors said the then-couple spent the money on a BMW, a New Year's trip to Las Vegas, gambling in casinos, Louis Vuitton handbags and other items.Bobbitt, who had been given $75,000, according to prosecutors, took civil action against D'Amico and McClure and the scam soon became public.Bobbitt pleaded guilty at the local level to one count of conspiracy to commit theft by deception and was put in a drug treatment program. If he fails to complete the program, he could be sentenced to five years in prison, according to prosecutors.McClure pleaded guilty in April to second-degree theft by deception in a plea agreement. She agreed to a four-year prison term but has not been sentenced, prosecutors said.Like D'Amico, both McClure and Bobbitt agreed to make restitution as part of their plea agreements.CNN's Eric Levenson and Laura Ly contributed to this report.
