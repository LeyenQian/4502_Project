It really is like my worst nightmare,\" Mississippi mom Ashley Lemay told ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nLemay installed a Ring camera in her daughters' room to keep an eye on them while she worked overnight shifts as a nurse.\nOnly four days after installing it, her 8-year-old daughter, Alyssa, heard music and a banging noise coming from the room where the camera was installed.\n\nAlyssa says that when she began looking for the source of the noise, she heard a voice saying, \"I'm Santa Claus, don't you want to be my best friend?\"\n\nLemay says the voice taunted Alyssa and encouraged her to mess up her room and break her TV before her dad came into the room and shut the camera off.\n\n\"I was even scared of my room for a few days. I'm still a little bit scared of it,\" Alyssa told \"GMA.\"\nIn response to the incidents, Ring said in a statement, \"Customer trust is important to us and we take the security of our devices seriously. While we are still investigating this issue and are taking appropriate steps to protect our devices based on our investigation, we are able to confirm this incident is in no way related to a breach or compromise of Ring's security.\"\n\n\"Due to the fact that customers often use the same username and password for their various accounts and subscriptions, bad actors often re-use credentials stolen or leaked from one service on other services,\" Ring continued. \"As a precaution, we highly and openly encourage all Ring users to enable two-factor authentication on their Ring account, add Shared Users (instead of sharing login credentials), use strong passwords, and regularly change their passwords.\"\nIn Georgia, a couple who asked not to be identified say they were horrified to hear the voice of a hacker in their bedroom via a camera they had installed to watch their puppy while they were at work.\n\n\"I see the blue light come on, and so I'm texting my boyfriend saying, you know, 'Why are you watching? We're laying down. We're about to go to sleep.' He's like, 'What are you talking about?'\" the woman told ABC affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta.\n\nSeconds later, she said she heard someone clapping and saying, \"I can see you in the bed! ... Come on! Wake the f--- up!\"\n\n\"I was terrified. I mean, I literally could not move my body,\" said the woman, who reported the incident to Ring.\nFor the Brown family of Cape Coral, Florida, the hack of their Ring camera brought racist abuse into their home.\n\nVideo from the camera taken Sunday night shows a home alarm being triggered, followed by a voice spewing racial abuse through the camera.\n\n\"Is your kid a baboon, like the monkey?\" said the hacker. The abuse continued for three minutes, until the family removed the batteries from the camera.\n\nDisturbingly, the family said their 15-year-old son did not appear on the camera during the incident, leading the family to believe the hacker had been observing them for longer than just that night, according to Naples ABC affiliate WZVN.\nIn Grand Prairie, Texas, a couple was rudely awakened on Monday when a hacker took over their camera system and demanded payment.\n\n\"I was asleep and our Ring alarm was going off like an intruder had entered our home,\" Tania Amador told ABC affiliate WFAA. \"Then we heard a voice coming from our camera.\"\n\nIn video captured by the camera of the incident, a voice can be heard laughing and then saying, \"Ring support! Ring support!\"\nIt continues, saying, \"We would like to notify you that your account has been terminated by a hacker.\"\n\nIt then says, \"Pay this 50 bitcoin ransom or you will get terminated yourself,\" before the hacker accessed Amador's doorbell camera, saying, \"I'm outside your front door.\"\n\n\"Very scary to hear a threat shouted over the camera for a ransom,\" Amador told WFAA. \"The fact that the person was watching and we don't know for how long is even scarier.\"\n\nEnjoli Francis and Kelly Landrigan contributed to this report."}
