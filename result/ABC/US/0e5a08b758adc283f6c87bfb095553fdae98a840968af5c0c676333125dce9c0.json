I think we're all questioning why,\" Pensacola Mayor Grover C. Robinson IV, told the audience. \"We can't control some of these individuals who wish to do harm.\"\n\nYet, amid the tragedy, Robinson said he was reminded of the city's spirit.\n\n\"Everyone working together to work in support of a mission \u2026 that's what this community is,\" he said.\nChief Deputy Chip W. Simmons, of the Escambia County Sheriff's Office, also attended the vigil and described getting the call about the active shooter.\n\nWhile officials often get reports of an active shooter, this was the first at the naval base, \"at a facility that we take so much pride in.\"\n\nHe remembers the closer he got to the facility, \"the more gunshots I heard over the police radio.\"\n\n\"It isn\u2019t until everything\u2019s settled down you realize what you\u2019ve seen,\" Simmons said. \"What you\u2019re experiencing is the loss of life, hatred \u2026 but also you realize what you\u2019re seeing is heroism.\u201d\nSimmons said officials are still working to determine exactly what unfolded and why, including whether or not the incident was terror-related.\n\nAccording to two law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation, authorities are urgently focused on two likely possible motives: whether the shooter had religious or ideological reasons, or whether there was a problem that developed in the course of his training at Pensacola.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper echoed that the investigation is ongoing at the Reagan Defense Forum Saturday afternoon: \"I can\u2019t say it\u2019s terrorism at this time.\" He said he will let the FBI do its work to determine the cause.\nEight people were transported to the hospital with injuries, police said. The conditions of those victims have not yet been officially released.\n\nHowever, Simmons said the three police officers among the injured are \"going to be fine.\" He said he didn't know the conditions of the others.\n\nNone of those injured have been identified.\nPastor Ted Traylor urged the community to support one another during this time. He also called on residents to be mindful when speaking about the tragedy.\n\n\"There\u2019s gonna be conversations about what\u2019s happened over here and I\u2019m gonna ask you be mindful when you have those conversations,\" Traylor said. \"It\u2019s a small community here and the person standing to the left or right could be involved.\"\n\nJust as there will be heightened security around the base, he said, \"I pray that our community has a heightened sense of sensitivity.\u201d\n\nABC News' Luis Martinez, Josh Margolin, Aaron Katersky and Christina Carrega contributed to this report."}
