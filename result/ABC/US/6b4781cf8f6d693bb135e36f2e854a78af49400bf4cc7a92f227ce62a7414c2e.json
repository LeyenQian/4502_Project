The Social Security Administration mailed a letter to Johnson's mother at her last known address, requesting that she contact the agency in order to confirm her continued eligibility for benefits, which were ended when there was no response.\n\n\"This was not a crime of necessity or desperation. Nor was it an isolated incident or a momentary lapse in judgment,\" prosecutors wrote in a memo late last month. \"The only reason Johnson's theft came to an end in 2017 was because one of the Social Security Administration's program integrity initiatives prompted the agency to confirm whether Johnson's mother was still alive. Otherwise, Johnson simply would have continued stealing from Social Security.\"\nJohnson withdrew funds from the account in an ATM at his police station, prosecutors said.\n\n\"Withdrawing crime proceeds at the police station he oversaw as the district commander reflects a troubling lack of respect for the law and a cavalier attitude about the nature and seriousness of his criminal conduct,\" the memo said.\n\nProsecutors said Johnson spent all but 59 cents of the stolen funds.\n\nIn handing down Johnson's sentence, U.S. District Judge Manish Shah called his actions \"infuriating\" and questioned why he never thought to come forward and accept the consequences for his crimes, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\n\"How many times (as a police commander) did you plead with people to come forward and accept responsibly for something?\" Shah said. \"Yet all that while, there was a crime being committed that you knew all about, and you did nothing to stop it.\""}
