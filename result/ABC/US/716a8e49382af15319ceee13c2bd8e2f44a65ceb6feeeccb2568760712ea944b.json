Christian Bollwage said in a statement Tuesday afternoon it was \"strongly considering going forward in joining Newark\" in a possible class-action lawsuit.\n\nAvery Cohen, de Blasio's deputy press secretary, blasted the lawsuit in a statement to ABC News on Tuesday.\n\n\"In the face of a regional housing crisis, the City of Newark has inexplicably taken a page from the Trump playbook, building a wall to single out and prevent families from seeking housing where they want to live,\" Cohen's statement reads. \"This is wrong, hypocritical, and amounts to nothing short of income-based discrimination. We will continue to fight to ensure that families have the right to seek stable and safe housing.\"\nSha-Kira Jones, one of several SOTA program participants named in the lawsuit, said she never wanted to live in New Jersey. She said she felt pressured to move there after living in a shelter for 10 months with her two young children while pregnant at the time, according to the lawsuit. They ended up in a Newark apartment, where the electricity stopped working and all the food in her refrigerator spoiled.\n\nShe claims complaints to her landlord were ignored, and New York City officials refused to intervene, according to the suit. She eventually learned she was living in an illegally converted apartment.\nAnother SOTA recipient -- whose name was not included in the lawsuit because the individual was \"fearful of future reprisal by the Defendants\" -- claimed in the lawsuit that her apartment was rodent- and roach-infested, the bathroom ceiling collapsed and that the heater never worked.\n\nShe said she was forced to leave the apartment when Newark city officials told her the building was being condemned.\n\nLoreal Bell, another SOTA recipient, said she was moved into an apartment in Newark that was mice-infested, had faulty wiring and no heat, according to the suit. She claimed that when she complained to officials at the New York Department of Homeless Services, she was told to contact Newark officials.\n\n\"Ms. Bell,\" according to the lawsuit, \"feels like she was 'dumped here and is now a Newark problem.'\""}
