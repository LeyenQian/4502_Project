And then he had a chest fracture and they had to drain blood from his chest. They rushed him into emergency surgery but he didn\u2019t make it,\u201d Flick said tearfully.\n\nA GoFundMe campaign to help support Flick and her 17-year-old son in the aftermath of Gallegos\u2019 death has brought in close to $50,000 from almost 500 donors.\n\"He always had a smile on his face, and he was always goofy and making everybody laugh,\" a clearly heartbroken Flick told WFAA.\n\nWith just a few weeks to go before Christmas Gallegos\u2019 sudden death has left an enormous void for his surviving wife and son.\n\nSaid Flick: \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough losing somebody when they are sick but at least you know it\u2019s coming. With this, you had no idea.\u201d\n"}
