Grewal then allegedly drove off in his rental vehicle.\n\nThe city's fire investigator determined the fire to be an arson, according to the police report.\n\nA few hours later, Miami Beach police were called to investigate an early-morning disturbance at the Design Hotel, where they encountered Grewal. A strong smell of gasoline allegedly fumed in his hotel room and on him.\n\nPolice then searched his car, where they discovered several empty beer bottles with paper towel wicks that resembled Molotov cocktails, according to the police report.\nGrewal was detained by police and taken to Mount Sinai Hospital for an evaluation.\n\nA Miami-Dade County judge on Monday set $100,000 bond for Grewal, who is charged with felony second-degree arson and criminal mischief, according to online records.\n\nHomeland security requested a detention hold for Grewal for overstaying in the U.S., police said.\n\nGrewal is represented by a public defender and has not entered a plea, according to online records.\n\nIf convicted, Grewal faces up to 15 years in prison.\n"}
