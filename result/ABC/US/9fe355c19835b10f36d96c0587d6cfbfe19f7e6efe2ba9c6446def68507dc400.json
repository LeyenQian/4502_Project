The officer called for help at 9:12 a.m. and first responders arrived at the school two minutes later, said Smith.\n\nThe high school, which has over 1,600 students, was evacuated and has been deemed safe, said police.\nBut the Oshkosh police said its officers are investigating \"a comment that was made on social media implying a possible threat\" toward another school in the area -- Oshkosh North High School, the department said in a statement.\n\n\"A comment was written on the Oshkosh Police Department\u2019s Facebook page under the post about the officer involved shooting that occurred at Oshkosh West [High School],\" the police department said.\n\nPolice said they do not believe students are in further danger and \"that this comment was not meant to be a threat against Oshkosh North High school.\"\n\nIn the wake of the officer-involved shooting, classes were canceled for Wednesday throughout the Oshkosh Area School District, said Superintendent Vicki Cartright.\nOn Monday, about 80 miles away from Oshkosh, a student brought two pellet guns to Waukesha South High School in Waukesha, Wisconsin, according to police.\n\nThe 17-year-old boy ignored police commands and pointed a gun at an officer, who then shot the teen three times, twice in the arm and once in the leg, said Waukesha police.\n\nThe student was hospitalized in stable condition, police said."}
