One concerns a subpoena from the House for Trump's financial records and the other is a demand from the Manhattan district attorney for his tax returns.\nThe court already has blocked the House from getting the financial records while it considers what to do with the cases. The district attorney has agreed to hold off enforcing his subpoena until the justices act. A decision on whether to hear the cases could come by mid-December.\nTrial judges and appellate panels in all three cases have ruled that the records held by the banks and Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, must be turned over.\nThe subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Capital One also seek documents pertaining to three Trump children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump; the Trump Organization; and other Trump business holdings.\nWithout a Supreme Court order, the banks would have had to begin turning over records to House committees next week.\nGinsburg oversees emergency appeals from New York.
