Agustin and Vincent J. Kapoi, Jr., who worked for the Department of Defense, were killed by a 22-year-old gunman, officials said.\n\n\"Our lives have been changed forever,\" said Kapoi's sister, Theona, who read from a statement to members of the media on Friday outside of the military base. \"There are so many unanswered questions, but we all have to be honest, it changes nothing because we can't bring him back.\"\n\nA third worker was also shot and was in critical condition, officials said.\n\nThe alleged shooter has been identified as Gabriel Romero, officials said. A machinist's mate auxiliary fireman from Texas, Romero was assigned to the USS Columbia, a submarine that was docked as the shipyard for routine maintenance.\n\nAuthorities believe Romero opened fire Thursday at the crowded military base near Honolulu.\n\n\"The incident happened in 23 seconds,\" said Norm Dominesey, NCIS special agent-in-charge at a press conference on Friday.\nOfficials are still investigating the shooting and the motive, though there are no apparent ties to domestic terrorism, Dominesey said.\n\nWhile it's unclear if Romero knew any of the victims, an anonymous military official told the Associate Press that he was seeking counseling and faced non-judicial punishment, which is a lower-level administrative process for minor misconduct.The civilians have been identified:- Vincent J.
