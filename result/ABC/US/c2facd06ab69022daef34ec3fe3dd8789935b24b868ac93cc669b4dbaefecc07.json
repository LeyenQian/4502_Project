He served with the Hayneville Police Department before joining the Lowndes County Sheriff's Department in 1987.\n\nHe was elected sheriff in 2010.\n\"Nobody had to question John's integrity,\" Heath Taylor, Russell County Sheriff and president of the Alabama Sheriff's Association, said at Monday's funeral at the Garrett Coliseum in Montgomery.\nWilliams responded to a gas station that night at 8:15 when he was shot. The suspect, William Chase Johnson, 18, immediately fled the store on foot before he was captured after state officials issued an emergency alert to search for him.\n\nJohnson has been charged with his murder. It was not immediately clear if he has entered a plea.\n\nTaylor said Williams, despite being a sheriff, didn't pass on the responsibility to answer the call.\n\n\"Just like he had done thousands of times before over the last 32 years,\" Taylor said. \"That was the type of love he had for his community. He paid the ultimate sacrifice for each and every one of us in this coliseum.\n\"He was a man of honor and pride and respect for others,\" Taylor said, overcome with emotion. \"Nothing made him happier than helping somebody in Lowndes County.\"\nAmong the Alabama sheriffs who spoke at the service was Montgomery County Sheriff Derrick Cunningham, who said he and Williams \"went everywhere together.\"\n\n\"He loved being the sheriff,\" Cunningham said. \"He would give you the shirt off his back. He's a true law enforcement officer.\"Our GCSO Honor Guard is in attendance at the funeral service for Lowndes County Sheriff John \u201cBig John\u201d Williams. #BlueLivesMatter #ThinBlueLine \ud83d\udc99 pic.twitter.com/tQs1V68U8ZOur Honor Guard is in Montgomery to pay respects to Lowndes County Sheriff \"Big John\" Williams at his funeral today.
