{"Title": "Thousands want criminal charges for deer attackers", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/475000-people-sign-petition-bring-maximum-punishment-men/story?id=67497770", "Article": "\nMore than 475,000 people are petitioning for criminal charges to be brought against two young men who were seen assaulting an injured deer.\n\nThe online petition, which, at the time this story was published, was just a few thousand signatures short of its 500,000 goal but was growing by the second, wrote that \"charges need to be filed with maximum sentencing.\"\n\nA video that circulated on the internet -- allegedly showing two people kicking the deer in its face, stepping on it and ripping its antlers out in Pennsylvania -- prompted the petition. The video has since been removed from Facebook but images appear to show the attack.\nA spokesperson with the Pennsylvania Game Commission told ABC News on Wednesday authorities are expecting to announce charges soon, but no arrests have been made.\nHe said he could not release details about the attackers or the area in which the assault took place.\n\nHe also would not say exactly what was seen in the video, but the commission on Sunday called it \"reprehensible and potentially a violation of the law,\" according to a statement.\n\nThe attack comes about a week after President Donald Trump signed a bill into law that make animal cruelty a federal felony.\nThe bipartisan bill, Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, criminalizes certain acts of animal cruelty.\n\nAnyone with information regarding the deer incident is asked to contact the Operation Game Thief Hotline at 1-888\u2013PGC-8001 or the Game Commission\u2019s Northwest Region Dispatch Office at 814-432-3187.\n\nABC News' Matt Zarrell contributed to this report.
