All the trucks have electric tailgate latch release switches in the tailgate handle.\nFord says water can get into the electrical wiring and cause a short circuit, activating the switches and releasing the latches. That could allow loose cargo to fall onto the road.\nThe company says it has no reports of crashes or injuries. Trucks with mechanical tailgate latches are not affected.\nDealers will fix the tailgate frame wiring harnesses and install a new tailgate handle release switch. Owners will be notified by mail during the week of Jan. 20."}
