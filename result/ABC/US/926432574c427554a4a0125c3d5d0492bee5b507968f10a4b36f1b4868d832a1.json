At Colton's funeral on Sunday, Furtick said he was stunned to see how many children came up to the family and said Colton was their best friend.\n\n\"A lot of them said that,\" his grandfather said. \"It's just heartbreaking to see him gone.\"\nWhile he said the family continues to grieve, the news of the organ donations has given them some solace. He hopes to meet those who now have Colton's organs soon and see, in person, how the boy's life has carried on.\n\n\"We're sitting here with our tears of grief while, at the same time, there are three families crying tears of joy,\" he said. \"We still got closure with our grandson and we still can help somebody else.\""}
