Let's start here.\n\n1. Where's Rudy?\n\nAs President Donald Trump faces an impeachment inquiry in Washington, D.C., Rudy Giuliani is in Europe meeting with current and former Ukrainian officials for a documentary series.\n\nThe president's personal attorney is working with One America News Network (OAN) to discredit what the far-right network calls \"the impeachment hoax\" and offer proof of Ukrainian corruption and 2016 election meddling, according to an OAN spokesperson.\n\nDespite heightened scrutiny in the impeachment inquiry and a campaign finance case involving two of his associates in the Southern District of New York, Giuliani is \"not letting up on his investigation,\" ABC News Senior Editorial Producer John Santucci tells \"Start Here.\"\n\n\"We know that from hearings over the last couple days that his associates have information that they believe is important to the impeachment inquiry,\" he says. \"We also know that Giuliani's business, Giuliani Associates, received a subpoena recently asking for documents and records related to Rudy's work abroad.  And ironically, where's Rudy right now? Abroad.\"\n\n2. Uber safety study\n\nIn a highly-anticipated safety report, Uber has revealed that nearly 6,000 sexual assaults involving drivers and passengers were reported to the ride-share company in 2017 and 2018.\n\nABC News' Taylor Dunn breaks down Uber's findings on the podcast and talks about next steps for the company.\n\nUber noted that \"riders account for nearly half (45%) of the accused parties across the 5 most serious sexual assault categories\" in the study, but added that \"any safety issue is exceptionally rare\" and \"by bringing hard data to bear, we can make every trip safer for drivers and riders alike.\"\n3. Border custody death\n\nThere's growing backlash over the death of Carlos Vasquez, a 16-year-old migrant, in a Border Patrol cell after video surfaced showing his final hours in May as he suffered from the flu.\n\nCurrent and former Border Patrol officials told ABC News Chief National Correspondent Matt Gutman that the agency was overwhelmed with migrants at the time and they conducted welfare checks, but the video obtained by ProPublica appears to indicate otherwise.\n\n\"Had he been taken to the hospital, he would have survived,\" Gutman says. \"Instead, he was taken to this cell. It is basically like a drunk tank, for all intents and purposes, with a concrete bed, and that's where he spent his final minutes.\"When 16-year-old Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez died in a Border Patrol cell last May, the agency released a statement.We obtained video footage that does not match the Border Patrol\u2019s account of his death. pic.twitter.com/MpIGS5B6Cg\u2014 ProPublica (@propublica) December 6, 2019 When 16-year-old Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez died in a Border Patrol cell last May, the agency released a statement.We obtained video footage that does not match the Border Patrol\u2019s account of his death. pic.twitter.com/MpIGS5B6Cg\n\"Start Here,\" ABC News' flagship podcast, offers a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.
