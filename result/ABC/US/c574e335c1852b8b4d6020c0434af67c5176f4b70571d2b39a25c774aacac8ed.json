He has yet to be sentenced.\n\n\"Singer directly or indirectly approached seven Stanford coaches about potential recruits between 2009 and 2019,\" Tessier-Lavigne said in his letter. \"The review found no evidence that any employee of Stanford Athletics other than the former head sailing coach agreed to support a Singer client in exchange for a financial consideration.\"\n\nVandemoer, 42, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering. He was sentenced in June in Boston federal court to six months of home detention and two years of supervised release. He also was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine.\nTessier-Lavigne said the law firm that conducted the external probe for the university interviewed more than 55 people and reviewed more than 35,000 records.\n\nThe two students for whom Vandemoer accepted bribes were never admitted to Stanford.\nThe university also rescinded the admission of another student caught up in the scam who included false information on an admission application, Tessier-Lavigne said. That student was not associated with Vandemoer's case.\n\nIn addition to conducting the external probe for Stanford, the law firm recommended several steps the university could take to fortify its admissions process against fraud.\nAmong the recommendations were:\n\n\u2022 Adopt a formal written policy codifying the school's approach to donations and athletic recruits\n\n\u2022 Require the school's development officers to independently verify the source and purpose of donations to the athletic department\n\n\u2022 Require coaches to flag to the admissions and office of development athletic recruits associated with third-party recruiters or consultants\n\nOther recommendations include enhancing training for coaches on the school's fundraising process and clarifying that fundraising results are not considered part of a coach\u2019s performance evaluation.\n\n\"Stanford embraces these recommendations and will be moving swiftly to implement them,\" Tessier-Lavigne said. \"Taken together, these steps provide for clearer policies, more training, fuller communication and stronger vetting that will serve as a bulwark against fraudulent efforts in the future.\""}
