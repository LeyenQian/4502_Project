A treacherous Monday morning commute is expected in the Twin Cities.\n\nNumerous snow alerts have been issued this morning from the Upper Midwest and into the Great Lakes.\n\nFurther south, heavy rain is moving through Indianapolis and Detroit.\n\nSome of the heavy rain will move into the Northeast later this afternoon into the evening hours, just in time for evening rush hour.
