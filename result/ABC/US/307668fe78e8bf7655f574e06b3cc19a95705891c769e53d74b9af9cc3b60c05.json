She fell on the ground and another tiger jumped on her and began to pull on her before they got her out and she got some lacerations,\u201d said friend and WEC attorney Michael Bradbury to ABC News\u2019 Los Angeles station KABC.\n\nWitnesses, including several members of the fire department, rushed to Perry\u2019s aid during the attack.\n\"A lot of people I'm sure that saw it were horrified thinking the worst. She said it was obvious they were playing with her because they do love her. She raised them from babies,\" said Bradbury.\n\nPerry has 50 animals at the facility including zebras, birds, and leopards.\n\n\u201cWe use live animal ambassadors for our outreach programs. The impact our information delivers to the public is second only to the impact created by the wildlife,\u201d says the sanctuary\u2019s website. \u201cThe animals are the real teachers.\u201d\nBradbury told KABC that animal control is aware of the incident but does not expect anything to happen.\n\n\"It\u2019s never happened before. She\u2019s ... been with those tigers, you know, on hundreds and hundreds of occasions and gone through the same kind of routine virtually daily,\u201d Bradbury said.\n\nBradbury says that Perry knows the animals didn\u2019t mean to harm her and that she is absolutely heartbroken over what happened and, as soon as she is released from the hospital and the investigation concludes, she will be right back doing her normal routine with the animals again.\n"}
