Let's start here.\n\n1. NATO's 70th\n\nPresident Donald Trump is in London for meetings with America's NATO allies to commemorate the military alliance's 70th anniversary as House Democrats move at full speed in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBefore departing for the trip, Trump told reporters the White House wouldn't participate in the House Judiciary Committee's public hearing on Wednesday and blasted Democrats for the timing \"because the whole thing is a hoax.\"Just landed in the United Kingdom, heading to London for NATO meetings tomorrow. Prior to landing I read the Republicans Report on the Impeachment Hoax. Great job! Radical Left has NO CASE. Read the Transcripts. Shouldn\u2019t even be allowed. Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?\nABC News White House Correspondent Karen Travers joins \"Start Here\" from London today, \"[Trump] doesn't like that there could be what they call the split screen: the president meeting with world leaders and House Democrats back in Washington debating what the threshold and the constitutional framework for an impeachment.\"\n\n2. 'What's left of this case?'\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments in its first gun rights case in nearly a decade on Monday regarding a challenge to a New York City law that has since been rescinded.\n\nSome of the justices questioned whether there was still a case at all, according to ABC News Senior Washington Reporter Devin Dwyer: \"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was just last month hospitalized for several days, was back leading the charge, asked the first question out of the gate, said, 'What's left of this case?'\"\n3. Chicago top cop out\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot fired retiring Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson on Monday, citing \"conduct that is not only unbecoming but demonstrated a series of ethical lapses and flawed decision-making.\"\n\nShe said her decision came after reviewing video evidence and an internal investigation into the night Johnson was found asleep behind the wheel of his parked vehicle at a stop sign one weeknight in October.\n\nJohnson originally blamed problems with his medication, but he later admitted to having \"a couple of drinks\" before he was discovered by officers. Lightfoot said Monday that he \"intentionally lied to me several times\" about the narrative. Johnson had not commented on his dismissal as of Monday night.\n\n\"There was clearly something in that video or in that inspector general's report that showed to her that he was no longer the guy for the job,\" ABC News' Ryan Burrow in Chicago tells the podcast.\n\"Start Here,\" ABC News' flagship podcast, offers a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.
