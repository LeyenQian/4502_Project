That fact that we didn't know caused even more anxiety,\" Ahmad said.\nYet, thankfully, she and other students exited through a door close to the mosque and everyone beelined toward it.\n\n\"I'm lucky that I was in that place when that situation ensued, and I'm just grateful that I was able to enter the code and let as many people in,\" Ahmad said.\nWhile she didn't consider her actions heroic, her father and uncle were stunned when they saw the video.\n\n\"When I look at the video now, I feel pride,\" Saad Ahmad, her father, told ABC News.\n\n\"Her composure is remarkable in that situation,\" he said. \"I don't know how I would react in that situation.\"\n\nHe added that while she looked calm, \"she was also scared.\"\nDuaa Ahmad's uncle, Khurram Ahmad, called it an \"uplifting\" moment in a terrifying situation.\n\n\"At first you see it, and you don't consider the subtlety in it that she remained outside,\" her uncle said. \"These are things that cannot be taught.\"\n\nHe also serves as the public affairs secretary for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, to which the Oshkosh mosque belongs.\nHe said about 100 students from the school ran to the mosque and sought shelter there, thanks to his niece.\n\n\"At that moment, it was her alone. Her basic instinct kicked in,\" Khurram Ahmad said.\n\nDuaa Ahmad is now focused on returning to school Friday and moving forward as a community, but she hopes that people will remember how terrifying these situations are.\n\n\"You never what that situation's gonna be like,\" she said, \"until you've actually experienced.\"\n\nABC News' Emily Shapiro contributed to this report."}
