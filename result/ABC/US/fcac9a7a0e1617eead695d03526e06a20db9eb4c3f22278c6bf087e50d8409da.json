His work was performed by the NAC Orchestra in 2016 after he received the Glenn Gould Prize for contributions to the arts.\n\n\"I was very impressed by the NAC Orchestra when receiving the Glenn Gould Prize, and was excited to receive this commission from them to honour the person, work and ethos of Peter Jennings, on a theme which is very close to my heart,\" Glass said.\nJennings began reporting for ABC News in 1964 and was named anchor and senior editor of ABC's \"World News Tonight\" in 1983.\n\nOver his long career he won 16 Emmy Awards, two George Foster Peabody Awards, several Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards and several Overseas Press Club Awards.\n"}
