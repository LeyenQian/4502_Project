More than 18,600 structures were destroyed in the blaze, which scorched upwards of 150,000 acres in Northern California's Butte County.\n\nImproperly maintained PG&E power lines were found to be responsible for sparking the blaze.\n\nFriday's settlement is subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.\n"}
