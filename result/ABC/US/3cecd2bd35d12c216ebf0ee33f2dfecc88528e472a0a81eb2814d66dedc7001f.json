They lived nearby and attempted to walk after their car got stuck in the snow. The area got about 10 inches, according to KNXV.\n\nThe Haas' front porch light was on, so they believe the couple was heading toward their house. They were 100 yards short, Mike Haas said.\nThey found the man lying on top of his wife, possibly in an attempt to keep her warm, according to the homeowners.\n\n\"It\u2019s sadness,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wish you could\u2019ve helped. You could\u2019ve saved a life perhaps. Maybe two lives.\"\nDiane Haas believes that if the couple had stayed in their car, someone driving along the road would have rescued them.\n\nA preliminary investigation found no evidence of foul play, authorities said. The time of the couple's deaths has not been established. "}
