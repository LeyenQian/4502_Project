The little boy was taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation and has since been released to child protective services, authorities said.\n\nDetective Allen Macias told ABC News on Tuesday that he did not know \"what was going through her mind at the time.\"\nHe said that while a concrete motive hasn't been established, Ruiz was going through a \"pretty nasty custody battle\" with the boy's father.\n\nIt was not clear how long before she set the house aflame that she called 911, but when firefighters arrived \"all three stories [of the home] were filled with black smoke,\" Macias said.\n\nRuiz was initially charged with only felony child endangerment, but on Monday night investigators found evidence to charge her with arson as well.\n\nShe was booked into the Ventura County Jail. Her bail was initially set at $50,000 for felony child endangerment, but is now at $500,000.\n"}
