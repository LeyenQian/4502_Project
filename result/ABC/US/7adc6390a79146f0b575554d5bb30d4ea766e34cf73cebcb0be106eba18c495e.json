First responders administered Narcan because they believed she was under the influence of opioids. The documents say she told police she had her last drink five minutes before the crash. Police say she admitted to drinking heavily every day and had been a heroin user.\nBrooks was a freshman at Dundalk High School, Baltimore County schools spokesman Brandon Oland said. \n\u201cIt's obviously a very sad week at that school,\u201d Oland said. \u201cOur thoughts and wishes are with her family.\u201d\nA vigil for Brooks was held at the crash site Thursday. A visitation will be held Monday and funeral services will be Tuesday, according to news outlets. \nJones waived her right to appear at her bail review Thursday. She's being held without bond at the Baltimore County Department of Corrections. It's unclear whether she had an attorney who could speak for her."}
