Brandon Caruthers, 17, remains on the run from the two escapees charged with lesser crimes, authorities said.\n\nThe teens were on a work detail when their staff supervisor left them to address a fight at another location inside the facility, according to police. They managed to get onto an elevator and used staff protocols to ride to the unsecured ground floor where they went through a series of doors and exited to the outside.\n\nAuthorities said an employee of the detention center drove around the area looking for the escapees for 35 minutes before he eventually called police for assistance.\nInvestigators said they more than likely had assistance once they were outside.\n\nYouth Opportunity said it was conducting an internal investigation into how the teens managed to escape. It said four employees had been placed on suspension pending the results of the internal probe, according to Nashville ABC affiliate WKRN.\n\n\"Youth Opportunity has provided a safe and secure environment for the youth and the citizens of Nashville. Youth Opportunity has heretofore experienced very few safety and security breaches,\" the company said in a statement. \"Youth Opportunity acknowledges that several members of its security personnel made improper decisions that, when combined, led to an opportunity for the four youth to leave the facility.\"\n\nAnderson said he \"had more questions than I had answers\" after reviewing a copy of Youth Opportunity's internal report, which is why he requested an investigation.\n\"In looking at their own internal report, I just saw a pattern of people not paying attention to what they should be doing, so that's the reason that I called for the review,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"What I saw in their report appeared to be a pattern of maybe nonchalant behavior,\" Anderson said.\n\nAuthorities said the teens are considered dangerous and are asking for the public's help in locating them.\n\nMarsh is suspected of killing 19-year-old Charles Easley in April.\n\nCaruthers had been transferred to adult court on an August 2018 armed robbery case in south Nashville, according to police.\n\nABC News does not normally name juveniles, but are doing so because police said they are dangerous individuals and have released their names and photos. Anyone with information about the escapees is asked to immediately call Nashville's Emergency Communications Center at 615-862-8600.\n"}
