She said she blacked out after having one drink there and found herself pounding on her front door when she gained consciousness later.\n\n\"All of my credit cards were stolen, my phone was stolen, they were used for thousands of dollars. The next thing I remember is running home to my house, which was over 4 miles away,\" Capra told reporters on Monday.\nCapra said she filed a police report and her family took her to a hospital, where a rape kit and a toxicology screening confirmed she had been drugged and sexually assaulted. She filed a lawsuit against the bar on Monday, accusing it of negligence and willful and wanton conduct after seeing surveillance footage of another woman being assaulted there.\n\nNo arrests have been made in either case.\n\n\"I\u2019m coming forward now, after seeing the video of Jane Doe, absolutely horrified by what happened to her,\" Capra said. \"I know it wasn\u2019t an isolated incident, and I know that it\u2019s happened to other women, and I can\u2019t sit back and live with myself knowing that I\u2019m not doing anything to stop it.\"\n\nThe other alleged victim, who is being represented by the same law firm as Capra, has not been named publicly.\nCapra said she developed a severe case of anxiety and became afraid to socialize in public spaces after she was allegedly assaulted.\n\n\"I never feel safe anymore the same way I used to. I used to be young and free. \u2026 That was taken from me, and I can't ever get that back,\" she said. \"It really changed my personality of who I am and what I do.\"\n\n\"There was years where I was looking over my shoulder every time I pulled into my alley, wondering are they here, because they know where I live,\" she added.\nEl Hefe did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment, but a spokesperson for its parent company, 15 Hubbard LLC, told Chicago ABC station WLS that it was working closely with the Chicago Police Department to investigate the claims.\n\n\"Any instances involving crimes of violence, sexual or otherwise ... are abhorrent. We will work with law enforcement,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nABC News' Ryan Burrow contributed to this report.\n"}
