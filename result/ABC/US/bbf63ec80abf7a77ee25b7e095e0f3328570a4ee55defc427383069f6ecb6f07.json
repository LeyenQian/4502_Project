I was angry,\" she added.\n\nCVS Pharmacy did not respond to ABC News' specific questions, but said in a statement they were \"reviewing and investigating the allegations made in the complaint.\"\n\n\"CVS Pharmacy is committed to providing access to emergency contraception, whether it is at the pharmacy counter for patients who have a prescription for it, or in our store aisles where we have sold over-the-counter emergency contraception for several years,\" according to the statement.\n\nA manager at the Thrifty White Pharmacy in McGregor told ABC News that the store had not yet been served, but declined to comment further.\n\nJess Braverman, the Legal Director at Gender Justice, the non-profit representing Anderson, condemned the pharmacist at Thrifty White, saying in a statement to ABC News that he ignored both his legal and ethical obligation.\n\nBraverman hopes that the lawsuit will \"ensure that health care providers uphold their legal and ethical responsibilities to care for their patients, regardless of the providers\u2019 personal beliefs.\"\n\nABC News' Matt Zarrell contributed to this report."}
