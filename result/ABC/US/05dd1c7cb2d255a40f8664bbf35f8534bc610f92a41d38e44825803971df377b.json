Before, users were opted in automatically.\nThe terms of service will not change, with respect to the use, purposes and processing of user data, Verogen CEO Brett Williams said in a statement.\n\nThe database currently has more than 1.3 million customer profiles, according to Verogen.\n\n\"We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting users' privacy and will fight any future attempts to access data of those who have not opted in,\" Williams said.\nUp to 70 violent crimes have been solved as a result of genealogy searches, according to the company. GEDmatch was the tool California authorities used to identify and catch the suspected Golden State Killer.\nThe technology works by taking DNA submitted by suspects' family members and creating a much larger family tree than those built using law enforcement databases, such as the Combined DNA Index System, aka CODIS, in which an exact match is needed in most states, genealogy expert CeCe Moore told ABC News earlier this year.\nOther direct-to-consumer DNA companies, including AncestryDNA and 23AndMe, do not allow their DNA samples to be searched by authorities, Moore said.\n\nABC News' Emily Shapiro contributed to this report."}
