The whole rescue cannot fathom him leaving. We all fell in love with him.\"\nSteffen told the outlet that the rescue organization received hundreds of applications from people who wanted to rescue the dog, but decided that the dog is no longer for sale.\n\nShe also feared the dog might be exploited.\n\n\"If somebody is going to make money off of him, I would love to see it go toward the rescue, and save thousands more dogs,\" Steffen said, adding that she plans to train Narwhal as a therapy dog.\nMac's Mission focuses on helping dogs with deformity, clefts and trauma \"since those get euthanized far more than any others and there is a great need to give them a chance,\" Steffens told ABC News. \"We give them that chance.\"\nBecause the nonprofit's life-saving efforts are strictly grassroots through social media, Steffens explained that Narwhal's story getting so much attention has been \"majorly epic for so many new folks to find out about our little awesome rescue.\"\n\n\"We really love our little Narwhal and the others he is helping here with the attention!\"\n"}
