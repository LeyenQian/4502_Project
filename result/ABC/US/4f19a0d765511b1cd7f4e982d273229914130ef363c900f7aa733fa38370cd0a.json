It's Christmas!\"\n\nJohn Schudel said that when his father Hal started the business, he was harvesting around 30,000 to 40,000 trees yearly.\n\"Today, we are shipping approximately 1 million trees per year,\" he said proudly.\n\nThe one million trees are planted across 7,500 acres and the process takes up to 900 employees, as well as a few helicopters, to get some of the heaviest trees to the truck.\n\"It takes a lot of people that are very committed, working 24/7...to cut the trees, load trucks\u2026to get them where they need to be at the right time and in the right condition to make it an incredible experience for our customers,\" said worker Jeff Larcam, part of the third generation of the Schudel family.There's a little bit of horticulture, a little bit of agriculture and a little bit of magic that goes into the whole thing.\nOnce the trees are cut, they are wrapped and sent to a warehouse in Los Angeles where they are then distributed to tree stands and farms everywhere.\n\"Just doing this for Christmas, once you do it for the first year, it's in your blood,\" said Alias Lopez, who has been working at the warehouse for 28 years. \"The scent of the Christmas trees, once they're in Los Angeles, everybody knows we're in town.\"\n\nLindsey George was recently shopping with her family for a tree 90 miles south in Fallbrook, California, at Vineyard 1924, where Santa was also visiting children and checking lists twice.\n\n\"You wait all year for your Christmas tree and it\u2019s nice knowing that people care so deeply about their own farm and what they\u2019re doing,\" George told ABC News. \"And we get the opportunity to bring it into our home.\"\n\n\"We decided to go all natural, U.S.A.-grown trees.\" said Rob Godwin, who was also tree shopping with his family. \"Best there is!\""}
