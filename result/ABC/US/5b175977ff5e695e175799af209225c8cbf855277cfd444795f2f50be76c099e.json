Mons. Richard J. Malone,\u201d reads the announcement when translated from from Italian, \u201cand appointed Apostolic Administrator vacant seat of the same diocese S.E. Mons. Edward B. Scharfenberger, Bishop of Albany.\u201d\n\nMalone is the first bishop in the 172-year history of the Catholic Diocese of Buffalo to resign from office. In a statement released after the Vatican\u2019s announcement, Malone acknowledged that his position had become untenable but continued to defend his legacy.\n\n\u201cDespite the measurable progress we have achieved together, I have concluded after much prayer and discernment that the spiritual welfare of the people of the Diocese of Buffalo will be better served by a new bishop who perhaps is better able to bring about the reconciliation, healing and renewal that is so needed,\u201d Malone said in the statement. \u201cAs such, I requested of His Holiness Pope Francis that he permit me to retire early, and he agreed to do so. \u2026 It is my honest assessment that I have accomplished as much as I am able to, and that there remain divisions and wounds that I am unable to bind and heal.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that while he \u201cwas made aware of the general conclusions of the report\u201d to the Vatican, \u201cmy decision to retire early was made freely and voluntarily.\u201d\nScharfenberger will take over the diocese immediately as a temporary administrator while the Vatican searches for a permanent replacement.\n\nThe Diocese of Buffalo has been in a state of crisis since last year, when Siobhan O'Connor, Malone's former personal secretary, leaked internal church documents to investigative reporter Charlie Specht from ABC's local station WKBW, sparking months of reporting about whether there had been efforts to conceal the extent of the problem from the public.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News that aired as a special edition of Nightline in July, Malone defended his leadership, including his decision to allow Fr. Dennis Riter, a local pastor who has faced multiple allegations of sexual abuse of children, to return to ministry after a lawyer hired by the church to investigate the matter concluded the allegations had \u201cno merit.\u201d Riter has denied the accusations and continues to serve as pastor of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Church in the Buffalo suburb of Dunkirk.\n\n\u201cI feel that in the almost 20 years I have been a bishop, I\u2019ve tried hard to be a good shepherd,\u201d Malone told ABC News, arguing that he had \u201cinherited a decades old horrific problem of abuse.\u201d\nBut the crisis only deepened in September with the emergence of secret audio recordings, made by Malone\u2019s then-secretary and diocesan vice chancellor Fr. Ryszard Biernat and obtained by both WKBW and ABC News.\n\nThe recordings suggest Malone sought to conceal allegations that an active priest had sexually harassed a then-seminarian, even though Malone can be heard on the tapes describing the accused priest as \"a sick puppy\" and calling his alleged penchant for manipulation and retaliation \"dangerous.\"\n\nDespite the ensuing public outrage and growing calls for his ouster from both religious and civic leaders, Malone initially appeared steadfast in his refusal to resign, suggesting the absence of action from the Vatican constituted an implicit endorsement of his leadership.\n\n\u201cThey say the pope frequently picks up the phone and calls people around the world, but I have not been the recipient of one of these calls,\u201d Malone said during an emergency briefing with a hand-picked group of reporters following the publication of the recordings. \u201cI\u2019ve had no communications from the pope at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know for sure they're not unaware of all the news around here,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut so far apparently I like to think they are trusting in my goodwill and my intention and my capacity working with other people to lead us further.\u201d\n\nThat changed in October, when the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, D.C., the Vatican's U.S. representative, announced that its office had authorized Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio of the Diocese of Brooklyn to conduct an \"Apostolic Visitation,\" described as \"a fact-finding mission which reports directly to the Holy See \u2026 to evaluate situations in dioceses.\u201d\nFollowing the announcement of Malone\u2019s resignation on Wednesday, DiMarzio released a statement on his review, saying that his team spoke with \u201cmore than 80 people over a period of several weeks\u201d but giving no indication of whether or when its conclusions might be made public.\n\n\u201cWhat I found are many deeply devoted Catholics who love their Church,\u201d DiMarzio said in a statement. \u201cI pray this moment of suffering and pain will lead to a birth of new faith. With the appointment of the Most Reverend Edward Scharfenberger, Bishop of Albany, to oversee the Buffalo Diocese, I am confident that Buffalo Catholics are in good hands. I hope that now Catholics in Buffalo can begin the process of moving forward, healing, and helping the diocese in all of its ministries.\u201d\n\nMalone\u2019s critics largely viewed the news as a step in the right direction.\n\nMatthew Golden, who has accused Malone of allowing Fr. Riter, his alleged abuser, to escape consequences, hailed the announcement as a \u201chuge victory\u201d for survivors of clergy abuse and their advocates.\n\n\u201cWith the persistence and determination of a few individuals,\u201d he told ABC News, \u201cthis glorious day in Buffalo has finally arrived. One done, Riter to go.\u201d\n\nMitchell Garabedian, the famed Boston-based clergy abuse attorney who represents 38 alleged victims in Buffalo, including one of Fr. Riter\u2019s other accusers, said Malone\u2019s resignation sends a \u201cloud message.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resignation of Bishop Malone provides hope to clergy sexual abuse victims that morality will prevail, justice will be served and that their voices can and will create positive change,\u201d Garabedian said in a statement. \u201cThe resignation sends a loud message to clergy sexual abuse victims to stand tall and be proud.\u201d\n\nAnd Siobhan O\u2019Connor, the whistleblower who sparked the initial scandal, said she is relieved after what she described as a long struggle for survivors and the diocese.\n\n\"For me, this is a time not for rejoicing, but for relief,\u201d O\u2019Connor said, \u201cThe resignation of [Malone] is long overdue.\u201d\nBut the future for Buffalo\u2019s Catholic community remains unclear. Both the FBI and the New York Attorney General are currently investigating the diocese, and Malone\u2019s successor could inherit a crisis, albeit more of a financial one, of his own.\n\nAccording to The Buffalo News, the diocese was considering filing for bankruptcy as it faces dozens of new lawsuits brought against the diocese following New York\u2019s opening of a one-year window outside the statute of limitations for new civil litigation from alleged victims of childhood sexual abuse.\n\nIn his introductory remarks to the media on Wednesday, Bishop Scharfenberger, the temporary administrator, stressed the need for a more \u201copen and honest\u201d approach.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be afraid of reality,\u201d Scharfenberger said. \u201cWe have to look at things with sober eyes and look at the damage that was done.\u201d"}
