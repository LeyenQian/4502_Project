These are 100-200 preying mantis eggs!\"\n\nAnd for those who don't believe it ... a Virginia veterinarian experienced a nightmare last Christmas when dozens of praying mantises roamed her home.\nMore than 100 praying mantises hatched from an egg case hidden under the branches of the Christmas tree Springfield resident Molly Kreuze bought for the holiday season, ABC Washington D.C. affiliate WJLA reported.\n\nThe bugs moved freely through the house, \"crawling on the walls, crawling on the ceilings,\" Kreuze told the station, adding that they gravitated toward light. Video taken by WJLA showed the insects hanging from the ceiling and crawling on the windows.\n\nThis year, Kreuze planned on buying a fake one, she told the local station.\n\nSo if you haven't taken a close look at your tree, double check behind the bigger ornaments just in case!\n\nABC News' Julia Jacobo contributed to this report.\n"}
