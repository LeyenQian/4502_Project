He also starred in a homemade music video, but the song never made it to the radio despite his multiple attempts.\n\n\"I would love the song to go all around the whole world, and all the children could hear it,\" he told KTRK-TV. \"I'm 83 now and I want something to happen to this song before, you know, I go meet my maker.\"\n\nThis year, his children and grandchildren spread the word about his wish. There was a YouTube video as well as a story on KTRK-TV and a post on iTunes.\nFinally, the family's message reached 104.1 KRBE in Houston. The station liked what it heard and invited Gondesen to hear his song played live on the radio.\n\nNearly 54 years after the great-grandfather had written and recorded the family song, he was able to see -- and hear -- his wish finally come true.\n\n\"It\u2019s happened! How do you feel?\" the hosts asked him on Dec. 4 in a video that was posted to Instagram.\n\n\"I feel wonderful,\" he said."}
