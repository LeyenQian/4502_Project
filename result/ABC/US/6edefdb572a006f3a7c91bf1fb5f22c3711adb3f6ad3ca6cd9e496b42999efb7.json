You might not be an athlete, you might not be the smartest kid in the classroom, but you're still on the team,\" said Dr. Denise Spells, principal of St. Ethelreda School. \"You get on the bus to go to your tournaments. You come in your T-shirts ready to play. We, as a school, win a trophy and everybody is happy. It's our own little community.\"\n\nAlthough St. Ethelreda School has collected a fair amount of trophies, these state wins have been historic.\n\"First off, we're talking all girls -- that hasn't happened in the state's history that just a group of all girls went as a team and won the state championship,\" Luster said. \"Second, we're talking about a group of African American girls, and I don't think that's happened in the state's history either.\"\n\"We always thought we were the best eighth grade team, but when we actually won, it felt empowering to know that we made history,\" Trechelle said.\n\nSpells wanted to do something big for the girls to show them how proud the entire school was of them, she said. As Shakira, Trechelle and Imani walked through the hallways of St. Ethelreda School, they were crowned alongside Luster, their coach, to make them feel like kings and queens of the school.\n\"Because the chessboard is ruled by the king, and the most important piece is the queen, they decided to crown us at the pep rally -- which surprised us because we were not expecting it,\" Luster said.\n\nWinning at the state championships, in many ways, is really just the beginning for these girls.\n\n\"Being on the chess team means a lot to me because it has helped out with my math and test scores a lot,\" Shakira said. \"So the more I play chess, the more I feel like my scores are going up.\"\n\nAnd to that, checkmate.
