Police say they can substantiate their claim with surveillance video that captured Lightner and her children \u201cfrom the moment they got off the plane..until the childs [sic] fall from the escalator.\u201d In the hour before the fall, police say the children can be seen playing near or on the escalator while the mother is nowhere in view on the video.\n\nRight before 9 p.m., 3-year-old Jaiden Cowart and his sister can be seen grabbing hold of the escalator railing from the outside and holding on as it goes up.\n\nPolice said the girl fell and a witness was able to catch her. But another camera at the top of the escalator shows Jaiden's hands nearing the top when he appears to lose his grip and fall 20 feet, police said.\nAn airport worker wrote in a separate report that he saw the boy suffer \u201cmajor trauma to the head.\u201d This worker said he called for a medic while \u201cfrantic\u201d passengers swarmed the scene, asking him to \u201cdo something.\u201d Police said Jaiden was laying in \"a large pool of blood.\"\n\nJaiden was taken to Atrium Health Hospital where he died three days later.\n\nLightner told ABC Affiliate WSOC in October that she and her kids had returned home from a trip to Florida and that they were picking up luggage when Jaiden went up the escalator and fell.\nPolice said Lightner \"allowed substantial risk of physical injury...by allowing the child to play, unsupervised, on an airport escalator.\"\n\nLightner told police that she was sitting on the stairs, watching her other children when Jaiden fell to the floor.\n\nLightner was arrested two weeks ago and was charged with three counts of misdemeanor child abuse, according to records from the Mecklenburg County Sheriff\u2019s Office. She was released from jail the same evening."}
