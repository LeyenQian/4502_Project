How much more presumptuous is it to say you\u2019re only going to serve one term?\u201d they added.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign and deputy campaign manager also took to Twitter to categorically denying that any have taken place.\n\n\u201cLots of chatter out there on this so just want to be crystal clear: this is not a conversation our campaign is having and not something VP Biden is thinking about,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager tweeted.\n\n\u201cNot sure what orbit of advisers reporters talk to,  but count me with @KBeds, this is not a conversation we are having among people who actually are running the campaign.  Also - hope everyone is seeing all the endorsements coming out for @JoeBiden,\u201d Biden\u2019s Campaign Manager, Greg Shultz tweeted.\n\nBiden, who would be 78 on inauguration day and the oldest president ever elected, often faces questions about his age on the trail and throughout his run for president has pushed back on committing one way or another on running for a second term.\n\nDuring his first interview after announcing his presidential run on ABC\u2019s The View, Biden said he wouldn\u2019t commit to only one term and that making a determination on that was not necessarily his choice.\n\n\u201cI may end up, if I get elected, only having one term, but the idea of committing not to do one term. Look, I, here\u2019s the deal: I think it\u2019s important for people, it\u2019s a legitimate question to ask about my age, and the dame question was asked of me at age 29, whether I was old enough to serve. It\u2019s a question of whether or not, hopefully, I can demonstrate, not only with age comes wisdom, and experience that can make things a lot better. And look, that\u2019s for you all to decide,\u201d Biden said on the topic.\n\nIn an October interview, Biden again would not commit on running for a second term if he were to be elected.\n\n\u201cI feel good and all I can say is, watch me, you\u2019ll see,\u201d Biden said in an interview with the Associated Press. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I would run a second term. I\u2019m not going to make that judgment at this moment.\u201d"}
