Now, his 2020 competitors will have to look elsewhere to go after the presidential hopeful.\n\nAfter a public call to his former employer to release information about his time at McKinsey, on Monday afternoon, the company decided to allow Buttigieg to reveal the clients he worked for from 2007 to 2010.\n\n\u201cAfter receiving permission from the relevant clients, we have informed Mayor Buttigieg that he may disclose the identity of the clients he served,\u201d a spokesperson for McKinsey said in a statement, adding that they take its commitments to clients seriously, including protecting their confidence, but \u201crecognize the unique circumstances presented by a presidential campaign.\u201d\nButtigieg released a summary of his three years at the firm last Friday. He said that in 2007, he served a nonprofit health insurance provider for three months in Michigan, and in 2008 he worked in the Toronto area analyzing prices for a grocery and retail chain. In 2008 and 2009, he worked mostly in Connecticut on research to fight climate change by improving energy efficiency, and in 2009 he worked in California for an environmental nonprofit. That same year, he also worked in Washington, with trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, for the U.S. government. His final project for McKinsey was from 2009 to 2010, analyzing logistics for a shipping provider.\nIn its statement, the consulting firm confirmed that the clients Buttigieg described \u201care all of the clients he served during his time at McKinsey.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s Senior Communications Advisor Lis Smith tweeted that the campaign would be releasing a list of clients soon.\n\nFollowing a forum in Waterloo, Iowa, on Friday night, Buttigieg fielded a barrage of questions from reporters who asked if he would break his NDA or how long he would wait for McKinsey to respond to his plea. Earlier that day, the mayor told ABC News\u2019 Whit Johnson, \"I don't think that McKinsey should force me to choose between keeping my word in a legal document that I signed in good faith and the need for the American people to know.\"\n\nA few hours before McKinsey\u2019s decision, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign also put an end to a line of attack from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, announcing that future private fundraisers will be open to press beginning on Tuesday, Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cIn a continued commitment to transparency, we are announcing today that our campaign will open fundraisers to reporters, and will release the names of people raising money for our campaign,\u201d Campaign Manager Mike Schmuhl said in a statement on Monday. \u201cFundraising events with Pete will be open to press beginning tomorrow, and a list of people raising money for the campaign will be released within the week.\nWhile campaigning in Iowa over the weekend, Buttigieg was repeatedly asked by reporters about the lag in making a decision. He said that his team was working through options to open the high-dollar events.\n\n\u201cJust want to make sure we do it in the, you know, if we approach this that we do in the right.\"\n\nFor weeks, Buttigieg was fending off attacks from his 2020 Democratic presidential competitor, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, as she continued to call him out by name over the weekend, asking him to open up those doors for transparency.\n\n\u201cNo closed-door fundraisers where they make promises no one can see. Every candidate needs to reveal what their bundler program is, where rich people get together and squeeze other rich people to be able to pull in money for the candidate, and in return get all sort of special perks from the campaign,\u201d Warren said in Rye, New Hampshire, on Saturday.\n\nButtigieg used to release the name of his bundlers early on his presidential campaign but eventually stopped disclosing that information.\nIn response to the attacks from Warren, Buttigieg would strike back with a call for the Massachusetts senator to release tax returns from her years as a corporate lawyer. Something Warren says she will not do.\n\n\u201cI certainly think it would be a good idea for her to release tax returns as I have, covering your entire career and in the private sector. I think that's one way to show your transparency. And I believe in transparency again and being as - as open as I can about my story, and what I've proposed today,\u201d the mayor said in Grinnell, Iowa.\n\nWarren did however disclose documents on Sunday night, showing that she received nearly $2 million from her private legal work over three decades.\n\nSchmuhl says the Buttigieg campaign \u201cstrives to be the most transparent in the field,\u201d pointing to examples of their three open press bus tours in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the mayor was on the record with reporters aboard the bus as it traveled to events, and the release of 12 years of his tax returns that cover all of the 37-year-old\u2019s professional life.\n\n\u201cNo other candidate for president has released the entirety of their tax returns since their education concluded. No other current candidate for president has released the names of people raising money for their campaign. There are important differences in this race among Democratic candidates, from creating a choice of affordable health care choices for all to removing cost as a barrier to college for those who need it, but transparency shouldn't be one of them,\u201d Schmuhl said.\n\nABC News' Ali Dukakis, Sasha Pezenik and Cheyenne Haslett contributed to this report."}
