{"Title": "AP FACT CHECK: Trump and the people he forgets he knew", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/ap-fact-check-trump-people-forgets-knew-67565249", "Article": "\nWhen certain associates and acquaintances of President Donald Trump get into hot water, he forgets he ever knew them. Various figures from the Russia investigation and the Ukraine matter as well as a British prince have fallen out of familiarity with the president in this way.\nFor a few days, the stock market suffered a similar fate when it dipped  too low for Trump to boast about it. But he  rediscovered the market by the end of the week when it rose back up.\nA look at some remarks by Trump from the NATO summit in London and from back home as the Democratic effort to impeach him moves ahead:\nPRINCE ANDREW\nTRUMP: \u201cI don\u2019t know Prince Andrew. ... I don\u2019t know him.\" \u2014 remarks Tuesday with NATO Secretary-General  Jens Stoltenberg.\nTHE FACTS: Trump knows the British prince. Andrew hosted a breakfast for him in June, they toured Westminster Abbey together and photos spread over two decades capture some occasions when they've met. The prince stepped back from royal duties after his involvement with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was exposed.\nTrump also recently declared, repeatedly, that he did not know Gordon Sondland, his ambassador to the EU, \u201cvery well\u201d and \u201cI have not spoken to him much.\u201d Sondland provided some of the most damning testimony in the House impeachment inquiry about how he had tried to carry out Trump's wishes to persuade Ukraine to investigate the president's political rivals in the U.S.\nSondland testified that he's had many conversations with Trump, who called the ambassador \u201ca really good man and great American\u201d before Sondland's problematic testimony.\nSeveral people in prominent positions in the Trump campaign or known as close advisers were similarly marginalized \u2014 as mere volunteers, hangers-on or low-level functionaries \u2014 when it became troublesome during the Russia investigation to acknowledge their stature.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSTOCK MARKET\nTRUMP: \u201cIf the stock market goes up or down \u2014 I don\u2019t watch the stock market. I watch jobs.\" \u2014 remarks Tuesday during NATO summit after stocks fell sharply.\nTHE FACTS: This is not true. Trump watches the stock market, as he demonstrated Friday when the market rebounded and he tweeted precise percentages of how much the S&P, Dow and Nasdaq have gone up this year. \u201cStock Markets Up Record Numbers,\u201d he tweeted.\nTrump uses the stock market as a leading barometer of his presidency, giving the subject a rest only when the market's performance is down. \nIt's an almost constant companion, through thick but not thin. \nOn a good day, he will tweet about it. Otherwise, his rally speeches and White House remarks are laced with references to the market's growth since he became president. He takes credit for gains and blames losses on other things, like Democrats.\nTrump tweeted about the stock market more than a dozen times in November as it repeatedly edged into record highs.\nOn one occasion, his boastfulness became too much even for him. He tweeted: \u201cStock Markets (all three) hit another ALL TIME & HISTORIC HIGH yesterday! You are sooo lucky to have me as your President.\" Then he added: \"(just kidding!).\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMACRON\nTRUMP, on French President Emmanuel Macron's assertion that NATO is suffering \u201cbrain death\u201d: \u201cHe\u2019s taken back his comments very much so on NATO.\" \u2014 remarks Wednesday in London.\nTHE FACTS: No, Macron did not back off what Trump had called a \u201cvery, very nasty\u201d statement about NATO. He conspicuously stood by it, before the summit, after it and when face to face with Trump in a tense joint news conference. If anything, Macron appeared to relish the provocation he had brought on.\n\u201cI do stand by it,\u201d he said Tuesday as Trump looked on. \u201cI assume full responsibility for it,\u201d he said Wednesday. And Macron tweeted: \u201cThe comments I made about NATO prompted a debate among members of the alliance. This dialogue is a very good thing.\u201d He likened himself to an ice-breaker smashing through ice.\nMacron characterized NATO as brain dead last month, citing a lack of U.S. leadership and confusion in the alliance about what its fundamental missions should be. He said the U.S. was turning its back on NATO and \u2014 in light of Trump's unexpected announcement in October that he would withdraw troops from Syria \u2014 not coordinating with allies on strategic decision-making.\nOn Wednesday, Macron mildly praised the summit as \u201cconstructive\u201d while emphasizing that the fundamentals that sparked his complaint had not been resolved.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nOCEAN DEBRIS\nTRUMP: \"I also see what\u2019s happening with our oceans, where certain countries are dumping unlimited loads of things in it. They float \u2014 they tend to float toward the United States. I see that happening, and nobody has ever seen anything like it, and it\u2019s gotten worse.\"' \u2014 remarks Tuesday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nTHE FACTS: He's right that garbage from abroad has come to U.S. shores by sea. What he does not say, when making this repeated complaint, is that garbage from the U.S. also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that Americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores.\nDebris from Asia was most noticeable after the 2011 Japanese tsunami, said marine debris expert Kara Lavender Law of the Sea Education Association, \u201cbut the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the U.S. and washing ashore in Asia.\u201d In fact, she said, most debris is not tracked to the country of origin.\nThe United States produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight, Law said.\n\u201cMost debris we find on the coast of the US is likely from the US,\u201d Denise Hardesty, a scientist who researches ocean trash for Australia\u2019s federal science organization, said by email.\nHardesty surveyed the U.S. West Coast from Washington to the California border with Mexico and found the dirtiest place was in Long Beach at the river mouth, where researchers found 4,500 items.\nMarcus Eriksen, chief science officer and co-founder of the 5 Gyres Institute, which fights plastics pollution, said Asian fishing gear arrives as debris in Alaska and British Columbia because of north Pacific currents, a problem exacerbated by the lack of regulation of such gear. But in pointing the finger at Asia, Trump is ignoring \u201cour own problems with plastic waste here at home.\"\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIMPEACHMENT\nTRUMP: \u201cThe word \u2018impeachment\u2019 is a dirty word, and it's a word that was only supposed to be used in special occasions: high crimes and misdemeanors. In this case, there was no crime whatsoever. Not even a little tiny crime. There was no crime whatsoever, and they know it. \u201d \u2014 remarks Wednesday with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.\nTHE FACTS: That's a misrepresentation of the conditions for impeaching a president. The         constitutional grounds for impeachment do not require any crime to have been committed. In setting the conditions, treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors, the Founding Fathers said that a consequential abuse of office \u2014 crime or not \u2014 was subject to the impeachment process they laid out.\nMonths after the 1787 Constitutional Convention, Alexander Hamilton         explained in the Federalist Papers that a commonly understood crime need not be the basis of impeachment. Offenses qualifying for that step \u201care of a nature ... POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself,\" he wrote.\nAs they move toward drafting articles of impeachment, though, Democrats are alleging crimes involving obstruction of justice as part of their case that Trump abused his office.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTRUMP, on his July 25 call with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy: \u201cAll you have to do is listen to the call or read the call. We had it transcribed perfectly. But he was \u2014 he said \u2014 no pressure, no nothing. There was no nothing.\u201d \u2014 remarks Wednesday with Conte.\nTRUMP: \u201cBreaking News: The President of Ukraine has just again announced that President Trump has done nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine and our interactions or calls ... case over!\u201d \u2014 tweet Monday.\nTHE FACTS: Trump misleads in suggesting that Zelenskiy didn\u2019t have any concerns about the call. Nor was the call \u201ctranscribed perfectly;\" only a rough transcript was released by the White House.\nWhile Zelenskiy initially said there was no discussion of a quid pro quo, he said in an interview Monday with Time that Trump should not have blocked military aid to Ukraine. Zelenskiy also criticized Trump for casting the country as corrupt, saying it sends a concerning message to international allies.\nOn that call discussing military aid, Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals in the U.S.\n\u201cLook I never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cBut you have to understand. We\u2019re at war. If you\u2019re our strategic partner, then you can\u2019t go blocking anything for us. I think that\u2019s just about fairness.\"\nOn corruption, Zelenskiy said it unfairly undermines support for the country.\n\u201cEveryone hears that signal,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestments, banks, stakeholders, companies, American, European, companies that have international capital in Ukraine, it\u2019s a signal to them that says, \u2018Be careful, don\u2019t invest.\u2019 Or, \u2018Get out of there.\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that in early October, Zelenskiy had told reporters \u201cthere was no pressure or blackmail from the U.S.\u201d But he did not state Trump had done \u201cnothing\u201d wrong, even as he let his criticisms simmer before surfacing them.\nIn any event, Zelenskiy         knew months before the call that much-needed U.S. military support might depend on whether he was willing to help Trump by investigating Democrats.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTRUMP: \u201cFor the hearings, we don\u2019t get a lawyer.\u201d \u2014 remarks Tuesday with Trudeau.\nTHE FACTS: Trump is wrong about being deprived of an attorney in the House Judiciary Committee hearings. The committee invited Trump and his lawyers to appear if he wishes, but the White House refused.\nIn a letter early in the week to Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined the invitation for the president\u2019s counsel to appear at Wednesday's hearing while Trump was at the NATO summit, insisting that the inquiry violates \u201cbasic due process rights.\u201d\nFor hearings in the coming week, Trump had until Friday to decide whether he would take advantage of due process protections afforded to him under House rules adopted in October. He was offered an opportunity to ask for witness testimony and to cross-examine the witnesses called by the House. But he decided not to participate in that round, too. \nIf the House impeaches Trump, the Senate trial will look like a normal trial in some respects, with senators as the jury. Arguments would be heard from each side\u2019s legal team for and against Trump\u2019s removal from office.\nThe Intelligence Committee hearings, in contrast, were like the investigative phase of criminal cases, conducted without the participation of the person under investigation.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nRONNA MCDANIEL, Republican National Committee chairwoman, on Democrats who said the Russia investigation should be part of the basis for impeaching Trump, not just his actions with Ukraine: \"Are you kidding me? They lied for 2 years about collusion & POTUS was exonerated.\" \u2014 tweet Thursday, using POTUS as an abbreviation of president of the U.S.\nTHE FACTS: She's wrong to suggest that special counsel Robert Mueller's report cleared the Trump campaign of collusion with Russia. Nor did the report exonerate Trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice. \nInstead, the report factually laid out instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, leaving it open for Congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once Trump leaves office.\nMueller's         two-year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with Russians. Among them: Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer who had promised dirt on Clinton. \nOn collusion, Mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term. \nHe looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front. \nMueller noted some Trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the Fifth Amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony, making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign. The special counsel wrote that he \"cannot rule out the possibility\" that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation's findings. \nMueller also did not reach a conclusion as to whether the president obstructed justice or broke any other law. \nHe said his team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge Trump, partly because of a Justice Department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn't be indicted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTRADE\nTRUMP: \u201cWe won, in the World Trade Organization, we won seven and a half billion dollars. We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations.\u201d \u2014 remarks Tuesday with Stoltenberg.\nTHE FACTS: He is wildly wrong to state that the U.S. never won victories in disputes taken to the trade organization before him.\nThe U.S. has always had a high success rate when it pursues cases against other countries at the WTO. In 2017, trade analyst Daniel Ikenson of the libertarian Cato Institute found that the U.S. won 91% of the cases it took to the Geneva-based trade monitor. \nAs Ikenson noted, countries bringing complaints to the organization tend to win because they don't bother going to the WTO in the first place if they don't have a strong case.\nAs for Trump's claim that the U.S. \u201cwon\u201d $7.5 billion from the WTO, that's not quite right.\nTrump was referring to a WTO decision         in October  siding with the U.S. on imposing tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European imports annually. The value of the tariffs on those imports is much less than $7.5 billion.\nThe WTO announcement culminated a 15-year fight over EU subsidies for Airbus \u2014 a fight that began long before Trump was in office.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nISLAMIC STATE\nTRUMP: \u201cWe have a tremendous amount of captured fighters, ISIS fighters over in Syria. And, they're all under lock and key, but many are from France, many are from Germany. Many are from U.K. They are mostly from Europe.\u201d \u2014 remarks Tuesday with Macron.\nMACRON: There are \u201cvery large number of fighters ... ISIS fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq and the region.\u201d Those from Europe are \"a tiny minority of the overall problem.\"\nTHE FACTS: Trump is incorrect to say the Islamic State fighters who were captured and held by the Kurds in Syria are mostly from Europe. \nOf the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. Most of the captured fighters \u2014 about 10,000 \u2014 are natives of Syria or Iraq.\nEuropean nations have indeed been reluctant to take detainees who came from Europe, frustrating Trump. But such detainees are far fewer than the majority he frequently claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTRUMP, on protecting oilfields in Syria: \u201cWe have the oil, and we can do with the oil what we want.\" \u2014 remarks Tuesday with Stoltenberg.\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s not true. The oil in Syria belongs to Syria and the U.S. can\u2019t do anything it wants with it.\nAs secretary of state, Rex Tillerson reviewed whether the U.S. could make money off the oil-rich areas and concluded there was no practical way to do so, said Brett McGurk, Trump's former special envoy to the global coalition to defeat IS. \u201cMaybe there are new lawyers now, but it was just illegal for an American company to go and seize and exploit these assets,\u201d McGurk         told a panel on Syria held in October by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\nStephen Vladeck, a national security law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said there is no solid legal argument the Trump administration could make if it sought to claim Syria's oil.\nWhile Trump has said he will withdraw the bulk of roughly 1,000 American troops from Syria, he\u2019s made clear he will leave some military forces in the country to help secure the oil from any IS resurgence.\nThe Pentagon has said it is committed to sending additional military forces to eastern Syria to \"reinforce\" control of the oil fields and prevent them from \u201cfalling back to into the hands of ISIS or other destabilizing actors.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBRITAIN'S HEALTH CARE\nTRUMP, speaking about claims that Britain's state-funded health care system would be part of future U.K.-U.S. trade talks: \u201cI don't even know where that rumor started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn't want to. If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.\u201d \u2014 remarks Tuesday with Stoltenberg.\nTHE FACTS: He's referring to his own past statements as a \u201crumor.\u201d\nAsked about the National Health Service during a visit to Britain in June, he said \u201cwhen you're dealing in trade, everything\u2019s on the table. So, NHS or anything else.\"\nThe service, which provides free health care to all Britons, could in fact be a bargaining chip in U.S.-U.K. trade talks. U.S. health-services companies can already bid for contracts if they have European subsidiaries. A future government could increase the amount of private-sector involvement or let U.S. companies bid directly. \nAs well, the U.S. could demand during trade talks that Britain pay American pharmaceutical companies more for drugs. Medicines became a big issue in negotiations on a revamped North American free trade deal, as the U.S. pushed successfully for tighter restrictions on the development in Canada and Mexico of generic versions of U.S.-patented drugs.\nLeaked documents from preliminary talks between U.S. and U.K. negotiators over two years from July 2017 \u2014 released by the Labour Party last week \u2014 said \u201cpatent issues\u201d around \u201cNHS access to generic drugs will be a key consideration\u201d in talks.\nIt\u2019s an overstatement to say the national health service as a whole would be up for sale, as Labour has alleged will happen if Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives win the Dec. 12 election and try to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the U.S. Britain would not be \u201cselling off\u201d the health service, as Labour asserts, because taxpayers would still be footing the bill.\nBut it's also improbable to think U.S. negotiators would \u201cwant nothing to do\" with Britain's health care market, despite Trump\u2019s words.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nEDITOR'S NOTE \u2014 A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker, Seth Borenstein, Darlene Superville and Paul Wiseman in Washington, Jill Lawless in London and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFind AP Fact Checks at         http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd     \nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter:         https://twitter.com/APFactCheck     "}
