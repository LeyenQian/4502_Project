A large crane was used to lift it into place on the West Front Lawn.\nThe Architect of the Capitol's Grounds and Arboretum teams secured the spruce and decorated it with thousands of ornaments handcrafted by children from communities in the state.\nThis year\u2019s theme highlighted the 75th birthday of the U.S Forest Service's most recognized fire prevention hero, Smokey Bear, who's based off a real-life cub that was found badly burned in the mountains of New Mexico.\n\nEach year, in consultation with the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Capitol Architect selects a tree from a different national forest. This year's tree was sponsored by the New Mexico Congressional Delegation, led by Democratic Sen. Tom Udall.It\u2019s here! The enchanting Capitol Christmas Tree made its way from New Mexico to DC.

Michelle Lujan Grisham delivered remarks at the ceremony, calling it one of the highlights of her first year in office.\n\n\"Because this, in fact, is what the holiday season is about: reuniting with your families ... sharing all of our own unique traditions, family spirit, recommitting ourselves to the kind of quality of life and courage that makes a difference in the lives of every single American,\" Lujan Grisham, a former House representative, said.\n\nThe U.S. Army Brass Quintet and singer Chevel Shepherd performed during the ceremony.\nThe tradition of the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree or \"The People\u2019s Tree\" began in 1964, when House Speaker John W. McCormack, D-Mass., placed a live Christmas tree on the Capitol lawn. The tree lived for three years before succumbing to wind and root damage.\nIn 1970, the Capitol Architect formally asked the U.S. Forest Service to provide a Christmas tree. The chosen national forest also works with state forests to provide smaller, companion trees for other offices in Washington.\n\nThe tree will be lit from nightfall until 11 p.m. each evening through Jan. 1.\n\nABC News' Benjamin Siu contributed to this report."}
