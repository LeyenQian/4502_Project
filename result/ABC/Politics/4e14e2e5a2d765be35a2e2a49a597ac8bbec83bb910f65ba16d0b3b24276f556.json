The action starts with Monday's Judiciary Committee hearing on the Intelligence Committee's findings and extends through the drafting of actual articles of impeachment.\n\nYes, Democrats have the votes to impeach. And yes, they believe they've accumulated enough evidence to make that happen before Christmas.\n\nBut key decisions about how many articles to draft, what they should cover and even whether all of them need to pass are still lingering. Knowing that other potential evidence awaits -- up to and including Rudy Giuliani's strangely timed trip to Ukraine and what President Donald Trump knows about it -- isn't helping Democrats reach a consensus.\nMissing from the calculations at this point are how or whether to entice Republicans to support impeachment. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said their choice is whether to be \"patriots or partisans,\" and final votes look increasingly to take place with zero GOP backing.\n\nGiuliani's travels aside, the Republican effort to portray as a circus what Democrats want to showcase as a sober responsibility has had some impact.\n\nDemocrats have been outspent in the impeachment fight, and are worried about being out-maneuvered. They still need to sort through their own conflicting instincts and political agendas before they can move on to the serious matter at hand.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nDeadlines have a way of motivating Capitol Hill to get to work, but they are also often used by members as leverage.\n\nIn addition to the self-imposed pressure Democrats now face to work quickly on impeachment, there's also a fast-approaching deadline at the end of the month for Congress to pass a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi said last week that she did not think Congress was headed for a shutdown.\n\n\"I don't think anybody wants that. I think the president and the Republicans learned in the last shutdown that \u2026 there was no upside to it,\" Pelosi said on CNN Thursday. \"And we're on a good path.\"\nOf course, Republicans have accused Democrats of being obsessed with impeachment and laser-focused on that path alone.\n\nDemocrats face extra pressure to show constituents when they go home over the holiday that they're continuing to legislate. Republicans could easily exploit that vulnerability, and, as always, Trump's willingness to sign on to any deal will be unpredictable.\n\nThe TIP with Christopher Donato\n\nAfter campaigning with former Vice President Joe Biden in Iowa, former Secretary of State John Kerry hit the campaign trail for Biden in New Hampshire. Kerry, who told reporters after one event that he has \"no desire to serve\" in a Biden administration, made his pitch of support for Biden's presidential campaign.\n\nKerry is no stranger to New Hampshire, having won the First in the Nation primary in 2004. He told the crowds in Nashua and Hampton that he wasn't here \"just for any old reason\" and that his reason was because \"I know that Joe Biden is the person who can beat Donald Trump and bring this country back together and get the job done.\"\n\nThe former secretary of state said it was important to have \"a president who understands that the next great infrastructure initiative of our nation is to meet the challenge of this crisis and to make it America ...\" and called out the president for his relationship with dictators such as North Korea's Kim Jong Un.\n\nKerry basked in the spotlight, speaking for over 30 minutes at both events. His home state of Massachusetts, just a few miles down the road, was on his mind.\n\n\"You're all very courageous,\" Kerry told the crowd in Hampton. \"I know the Patriots are playing. ... Joe Biden is like the Patriots. Fun to watch the promise and the potential of the young quarterbacks. But come February, I like having an experienced Tom Brady.\"\nONE MORE THING\n\nThe long-awaited Department of Justice Inspector General report examining the origins of the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is set to be released Monday, in a moment sure to draw intense political scrutiny on the activities of law enforcement agents tasked with probing contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Russia.
