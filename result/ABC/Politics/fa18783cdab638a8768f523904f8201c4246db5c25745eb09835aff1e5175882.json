{"Title": "Key players in the Trump impeachment probe and what they testified to Congress", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-testified-congress/story?id=66763043", "Article": "\nSince House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry in September, there has been a steady drumbeat of current and former administration and government officials who have come forward, either willingly or under subpoena, to testify in the rapidly developing probe.\n\nAt the heart of the inquiry is President Donald Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and whether the administration withheld nearly $400 million in aid and a White House summit between the two leaders in exchange for an investigation into the president\u2019s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter for his work on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nTrump also allegedly wanted the aid withheld unless there was an investigation into a largely debunked theory that it was Ukrainians, not Russians, who tried to interfere in the 2016 election \u2013 on behalf of Hillary Clinton \u2013 and the Democrats' purported efforts on that front.\n\nA number of questions surround the call, including Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u2019s alleged role in lobbying the Ukrainian government through back channels, the involvement of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and why exactly U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was recalled.\n\nDemocrats say the testimony, both from open proceedings and closed-door depositions, paints a picture of the president\u2019s abuse of power to pursue politically motivated investigations. Republicans have raced to Trump\u2019s defense, saying there was no evidence of a quid pro quo and that the witnesses did not have direct knowledge of Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is set to hear this week from constitutional scholars and legal experts as it prepares to potentially draft articles of impeachment.\n\nHere are the people who have testified so far and what they said:\n\nABC News' Benjamin Siegel, John Santucci, Katherine Faulders, Matthew Mosk, Ali Dukakis, Allison Pecorin, Laura Romero, Lucien Bruggeman, Soo Rin Kim, Justin Fishel, Megan Hughes, Jordyn Phelps, Shannon Crawford, Kathryn McQuade, Connor Finnegan and Cindy Smith contributed to this report."}
