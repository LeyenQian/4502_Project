This is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country by far. It's not even like an impeachment.\u201d\n\nTrump pointed out \"bribery\" and \"crimes\" aren't specifically alleged in the articles, trying to minimize the seriousness of the Democrats' effort.\n\n\"People are saying they\u2019re not even doing a crime. What happened? All of these horrible things. Remember? Bribery and this and that -- where are they? Trump said. \"They said these two things, they\u2019re not even a crime,\" he said.\n\nHe called them \"these two flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous articles of impeachment. The House Democrats are walking back from everything they claimed with today's announcement. They are now admitting there was no collusion. There was no obstruction of justice. And there were no crimes whatsoever. There are no crimes. It says it. There are no crimes. They are impeaching me and there are no crimes,\" he said.\nThe two articles of impeachment announced Tuesday charge the president with abuse of power and obstruction of justice. The House Judiciary Committee move represents a historic moment as only the fourth time the House has introduced and considered articles of impeachment against a sitting president.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House is expected to vote to pass the articles before leaving for the holiday recess, which would make Trump the third president in American history to be impeached.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats argued the that the president \"solicited interference of a foreign government, Ukraine,\" to \"influence the 2020 United States presidential election to his advantage\u201d and then obstructed Congress from its rightful duty to pursue an impeachment inquiry with \"the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance\" of subpoenas and request for testimony.\nThe president blasted the two charges as nothing more than a political attempt to regain the White House in 2020.\n\n\"This has to be a first in history. They are impeaching me. You know why? Because they want to win an election and that\u2019s the only way they can do it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the president and his allies argue Democrats are trying to unseat the president now because they are not confident they can beat him at the ballot box in next November\u2019s election, Democrats maintain that the real threat to the next election would be if they did nothing.\n\n\u201cIf we did not hold him accountable, he would continue to undermine our election. Nothing less is at stake than the central point of our democracy \u2013 a free and fair election,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at an event with POLITICO following Tuesday\u2019s introduction of the articles of impeachment.\n\nEven as the president rails against the prospect of impeachment, something he says is a \u201cvery ugly word,\u201d he insists that it is actually helping him politically.\n\n\u201cOur poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment,\u201d the president consistently claims despite persistent poll numbers that demonstrate the president\u2019s historic unpopularity.\n\nThe president also pointed to his fresh victory with the USMCA trade deal \u2013 a victory House Speaker Nancy Pelosi handed to the president on the same day Democrats introduced impeachment articles \u2013 as an upside to the impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt, that's the reason they approved USMCA. So that's okay with me,\u201d the president said, claiming that Pelosi made the split-screen announcement because Democrats are \u201cembarrassed\u201d by impeachment.  Pelosi has called it a victory for American workers and \"we ate their lunch\" referring to how Democrats struck the deal with the White House.\n\n\u201cThey announced impeachment, then an hour later she announced that she is going to do USMCA. You know why, it's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment,\u201d Trump claimed.\n\nWhile the president offered his own interpretation of Pelosi\u2019s calculation in the near-simultaneous announcements, the dual actions also had the effect of demonstrating an ability to govern and impeach the president at the same time, thus undercutting a White House criticism that impeachment has kept Democrats from pursuing the interests of the American people.\n"}
