{"Title": "Who's running for president in 2020?", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/potential-2020-candidates-stand-midterms/story?id=59316177", "Article": "\nFollowing Democrats' sweeping victories in the House of Representatives during the 2018 midterm elections, many in the party were eagerly anticipating the 2020 presidential election and the opportunity to unseat President Donald Trump.\n\nThe field of candidates remains large, even with candidates dropping out. In November, for example, two people who had earlier ruled out 2020 runs launched presidential campaigns.\n\nThree Republican challengers also declared their intention to run, even as some state party officials were canceling their nominating contests. Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford suspended his challenge to Trump in the Republican primary two months after announcing.\n\nHere's a list of all the candidates in the race (in alphabetical order):\n\nThe senior senator from Colorado announced his presidential bid during a May 2 appearance on CBS This Morning, just weeks after a successful prostate cancer operation.\n\nBennet said his ability to win over Republican constituents and colleagues, and his \"broad\" experience in the public and private sectors, distinguish him in a crowded Democratic field.\n\n\"I think this country faces two enormous challenges, among others,\" he said in the CBS interview. \"One is a lack of economic mobility and opportunity for most Americans, and the other is the need to restore integrity to our government.\"\nBennet caught people's attention with a viral speech on the Senate floor during the government shutdown in January. He tore into Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for the role he said he played during another government shutdown in 2013.\n\nThe former vice president and senator from Delaware announced his bid April 25 in an online video.\n\nIn the video, he denounced the white supremacists who marched on Charlottesville in 2017 and Trump's response, calling it a \"defining moment for this nation in the last few years.\"\n\n\"We are in a battle for the soul of this nation,\" Biden said in the video.\nBiden entered the race with the kind of name recognition that made him a de facto front-runner. But he's also faced questions about accusations from women about unwanted touching, money, messaging, age, identity and ideology in a political environment vastly different from the one he began his career in decades ago.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially entered the Democratic primary in November, launching an unconventional pursuit of the party\u2019s presidential nomination after years of flirting with a bid for the nation's highest office.\n\n\"I offer myself as a doer and a problem solver -- not a talker. And as someone who is ready to take on the tough fights \u2013 and win,\" Bloomberg said in a statement on his website. \"Defeating Trump -- and rebuilding America -- is the most urgent and important fight of our lives. And I\u2019m going all in.\"\n\nHe made a pricey entrance into the race with an eight-figure television ad campaign and advertisements promoting his bio and taking direct aim at President Donald Trump.\n\nHis campaign launch, less than three months before the first votes are cast in the Iowa caucuses, added more uncertainty into an already unsettled primary season.\nThe New Jersey senator and former mayor of Newark declared his candidacy on Feb. 1 after spending time last year campaigning for Democrats in Iowa, Nevada, South Carolina and Mississippi.\n\nBooker has campaigned on a message of unity and collective action, promising to bring Democrats and Republicans together like he has on issues such as criminal justice reform during his time in the Senate.\n\n\"I think a lot of folks are beginning to feel that the forces that are tearing us apart in this country are stronger than the forces that tie us together. I don't believe that,\" Booker said on ABC's \"The View\" the day he announced his campaign. \"So, I'm running to restore our sense of common purpose, to focus on the common pain that we have all over this country.\"\nButtigieg first made a national name for himself with a bid for Democratic National Committee chair in 2017. At 37 years old, he was the youngest candidate in the 2020 race, and could also become the first gay man to be elected president.\n\nWhile he trailed many of his opponents in name recognition early on, Buttigieg argued that he could represent a generational shift in government, and speaks frequently of issues that will affect younger Americans, such as tax reform, gun control and climate change.\n\"I get the audacity of somebody like me talking about running for this office, but frankly it's a leap for anybody,\" Buttigieg said on ABC's \"This Week\" in February. \"And yet all of the people who had that job have been mortals who just bring their experience to the table. My experience is that of guiding a city through transformation, and I think a mayor at any level has the kind of executive frontline government experience and, by the way, problem-solving experience that we need more in Washington right now.\"\n\nButtigieg officially entered the race on April 14 at a rally in his hometown of South Bend.\n\nCastro, who served as mayor of San Antonio, Texas, before spending over two years in President Barack Obama's cabinet, announced his campaign in his hometown in January.\n\n\"I'm running for president because it's time for new leadership, because it's time for new energy, and it's time for a new commitment to make sure that the opportunities I've had are available for every American,\" he said.\n\nIn 2016, Castro was vetted by Hillary Clinton to be her running mate, but the spot ultimately went to Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., This year, he said he is eager to restore the style of leadership the nation had under Obama.\nThe Maryland congressman was only seven months into his third term when he announced his candidacy in July 2017, becoming the first member of Congress to launch a bid in the 2020 cycle.\n\nWhile Delaney, a millionaire entrepreneur and businessman before arriving in Congress, does not have the name recognition of the other likely candidates, he has already traveled to all of Iowa's 99 counties -- a right of passage for many caucus hopefuls -- and frequently discusses his pragmatic approach and desire to bridge political gaps.\n\n\"What the American people are really looking for is a leader to try to bring us together, not actually talk like half the country's entirely wrong about everything they believe,\" Delaney said on ABC's \"This Week\" in January, adding, \"One of the things I've pledged is in my first hundred days, only to do bipartisan proposals. Wouldn't it be amazing if a president looked at the American people at the inauguration and said, \u2018I represent every one of you, whether you voted for me or not and this is how I'm going to prove it.'\"\nDemocrat and Iraq War veteran Gabbard announced her presidential bid in January in an appearance on CNN.\n\n\"When we stand together, united by our love for each other and for our country, there is no challenge we cannot overcome. Will you join me?\" Gabbard tweeted.\n\nEarly on in her campaign, the first American Samoan and the first Hindu member of Congress faced questions over her work in the early 2000's for an anti-gay organization run by her father and her defense of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, with whom she controversially met in 2017.\nKlobuchar launched her campaign on a snowy February day in Minneapolis, laying out a platform that included a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizen's United Supreme Court decision, signing back on to the Paris climate agreement and advocating for criminal justice reform and universal health care.\n\n\"I'm running for every parent who wants a better world for their kids,\" Klobuchar said at her opening rally. \"I'm running for every student who wants a good education. For every senior who wants affordable prescription drugs. For every worker, farmer, dreamer, builder. For every American. I'm running for you.\"\n\nThe Minnesota senator is viewed favorably by some in Democratic circles for her ability to perform strongly in her home state -- part of a Midwestern region that helped President Trump to victory in 2016.\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick\nPatrick, the former two-term governor of Massachusetts and the state's first black chief executive, formally announced a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in a sharp reversal from his 2018 decision to not pursue a run -- injecting more uncertainty into an unsettled primary less than three months before the first votes.\n\n\"I've had the chance to live my American dream,\" he said in a November announcement video. \"But over the years, I've seen the path to that dream closing off bit by bit. The anxiety and even anger that I saw in my neighbors on the South Side, the sense that the government and the economy were letting us down, were no longer about us, is what folks feel all over America today in all kinds of communities.\"\nFollowing his announcement, he traveled to New Hampshire and filed paperwork to appear on the primary ballot. It was a day before the deadline to file.\n\nWhile in Manchester, New Hampshire, he told ABC News' Whit Johnson, \"I wouldn't be in it if I didn't think I could win it.\"\n\nAfter a 2016 campaign that saw him amass millions of supporters even as he finished second to Clinton, Sanders entered the 2020 race in February, predicting victory and pointing to the progressive ideas he had championed as an outsider during the last cycle, like \"Medicare for All\" and free college tuition, that have since become increasingly mainstream.\n\nIn an email to supporters announcing the launch of his campaign, Sanders further took aim at Trump, using some of the starkest language of a Democratic candidate up to that point.\n\n\"You know as well as I do that we are living in a pivotal and dangerous moment in American history,\" he wrote. \"We are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction.\"\nTom Steyer\nTom Steyer, a billionaire liberal activist from California, in July became the 26th major Democratic figure to enter the 2020 race, reversing course on a statement he made months earlier saying he wouldn't run.\n\nSteyer has poured millions of his own money into electing Democrats throughout the years, and said in January that he would redouble his efforts to impeach the president instead of seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. But in a tweet following his presidential campaign announcement, he conceded that his efforts to \"hold the president accountable\" are \"not enough.\"\n\nIn his four-minute announcement video, Steyer unveiled a campaign platform that focused on curbing the influence of corporations in politics and combating climate change.\n\n\"Really what we're doing is make democracy work by pushing power down to the people,\" he said.\nPresident Donald Trump\nOn the same day he assumed the office of the presidency in 2017, Trump filed preliminary paperwork with the Federal Election Committee (FEC) to qualify as a presidential candidate for 2020.\n\nTrump's re-election campaign announced in early April that it raised more than $30 million in the first quarter of 2019, a total that outpaces all of his Democratic rivals and indicates he will be well-resourced in his bid for a second term in the Oval Office.\n\"Our prodigious fundraising is further proof of President Trump's clear record of accomplishment on behalf of the American people,\" wrote Brad Parscale, campaign manager for Trump's re-election campaign.\n\nConservative firebrand former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh announced in August on ABC's \"This Week\" that he's launching a long-shot Republican presidential primary challenge against the president.\n\nWhen ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos pointed out the massive uphill climb Walsh has in front of him in the primary thanks to Trump's overwhelmingly high approval rating within the party, the controversial former congressman argued that conservatives should have an alternative to the president.\n\"I'm running because he's unfit; somebody needs to step up and there needs to be an alternative. The country is sick of this guy's tantrum -- he's a child,\" said Walsh, who was elected to the House in the 2010 Tea Party wave, but only served one term before becoming a conservative talk radio host.\n\nThe former Illinois congressman-turned-radio host was once a fervent Trump supporter but has become a fierce critic of the president. Walsh was the second Republican to jump into the primary to challenge Trump.\n\nAfter establishing a presidential exploratory committee just before New Year's, Warren officially joined the race in February with an event in Massachusetts.\n\n\"This is the fight of our lives,\" the senator said. \"The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone. I am in that fight all the way.\"\n\nA prolific fundraiser whose staffers spent time in a number of early primary states assisting other Democrats, Warren said in September that following the midterms she would \"take a hard look at running for president,\" becoming one of the first major names to take steps towards a run.\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld announced in April that he's officially running for president, becoming the first Republican to mount a primary challenge against the president.\n\nWeld, a current partner at the Mintz Levin law firm and the 2016 vice presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party, said he would have been \"ashamed\" if he passed on running against Trump for the Republican party nomination.\n\"I'd be ashamed of myself if hadn't raised my hand and said, 'Count me in,'\" he told ABC News shortly after his announcement. \"I think that the president is a very divisive force and that's just not my style, and it's not what Americans deserve.\"\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson announced the launch of her campaign in Los Angeles in January after making six trips to Iowa and one to New Hampshire over the past year as she explored a bid.\n\nWilliamson is best known outside of political circles as the author of several popular self-help books and as a \"spiritual friend and counselor\" to Oprah Winfrey, with multiple appearances on her show and television network.\n\nShe also ran to represent California's 33rd congressional district in 2014 as an independent, finishing fourth in the open primary, after endorsements from then-Rep. Keith Ellison, former Govs. Jennifer Granholm and Jesse Ventura, and former Reps. Dennis Kucinich and Alan Grayson.\nYang, an entrepreneur, is running a presidential campaign most commonly noted for its support of universal basic income -- a pledge to provide all Americans 18 and older with $1,000 per month.\n\nYang speaks frequently about both income inequality and the economic transformation that has enriched certain parts of the country while disproportionately harming regions that have failed to keep pace.\n\"I was stunned when I saw the disparities between Detroit and San Francisco or Cleveland and Manhattan. You feel like you're traveling across dimensions and decades and not just a couple of time zones,\" Yang told \"Rolling Stone\" in January. \"None of our political leaders are willing to acknowledge the elephant in the room that is tearing our communities apart, in the form of technological change.\"\n\nThe following candidates have dropped out of the 2020 election:\n\nMontana Gov. Steve Bullock is most notably known for winning in 2016 as a Democrat in a state that helped elect Trump.\n\n\"As a Democratic governor in a state Trump won by 20 points, I don't have the luxury of only talking to people who agree with me,\" Bullock said in his May announcement video. \"I go all across our state's 147 thousand square miles and look for common ground to get things done.\"\nHe campaigned for 202 days, but failed to gain traction at the national level, did not reach 2% in any of the Democratic National Committee qualifying polls and only made one debate stage. He suspended his campaign on Dec. 2 and said in a statement, \"While there were many obstacles we could not have anticipated when entering this race, it has become clear that in this moment, I won\u2019t be able to break through to the top tier of this still-crowded field of candidates.\"\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\nNew York City's mayor released a video on Youtube, announcing his campaign launch on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nDe Blasio, who is in his second term, joined a crowded field of nearly two dozen Democrats in the race for the White House. The central theme of de Blasio's campaign was \"working people first.\"\nOn Sept. 20, de Blasio announced he was dropping out of the race. The mayor struggled in the polls and did not qualify for the third round of Democratic primary debates, hosted by ABC News.\n\n\"Getting out there, being able to hear people's concerns, address them with new ideas has been an extraordinary experience,\" he said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \"But I have to tell you, at the same time I feel like I've contributed all I can to this primary election and it's clearly not my time. So I'm gonna end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City, and I'm gonna keep speaking up for working people.\"\n\nThe New York Democrat formally announced her presidential run on March 17 in a video posted to her verified YouTube account. In January, she had announced that she was forming a presidential exploratory committee during an appearance on CBS' \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\"\n\n\"I'm going to run for president of the United States because, as a young mom, I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own,\" she said during the interview.\n\nOn Aug. 28, Gillibrand announced she was ending her presidential campaign. In a video posted to her Twitter account, Gillibrand thanked her supporters and made a call to action to defeat Trump and secure a Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\"We wanted to win this race, but it's important to know when it's not your time, and to know how you can best serve your community and country,\" she said. \"I believe I can best serve by helping to unite us to beat Donald Trump in 2020.\"\nMike Gravel's unlikely bid for president was launched by two teenagers who learned about him through a podcast and encouraged the former Alaska senator to run for president in 2020.\n\nHaving failed to make the debate stage during the first two Democratic debates, Gravel's team decided to close up shop on their campaign and redirect their efforts towards a think tank. In a video posted to Twitter, he endorsed Sanders for president.\n\nHis campaign was being transitioned into a progressive think tank called the Gravel Institute.\nFollowing months of speculation surrounding the junior senator from California, Harris officially announced her 2020 candidacy on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" in January.\n\n\"I love my country. I love my country,\" she said. \"This is a moment in time that I feel a sense of responsibility to stand up and fight for the best of who we are.\"\n\nIf Harris were to win the 2020 presidential election, she would have become the first woman and woman of color to ascend to the nation's highest office. However, she announced the suspension of her presidential bid in December.\n\n\"My campaign for president simply doesn\u2019t have the financial resources we need to continue,\" she said in an email statement to her supporters. \"I\u2019m not a billionaire. I can\u2019t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it\u2019s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete.\"\nHickenlooper joined the field in early March, seeking to parlay his success in growing Colorado's economy while passing environmental regulations and gun control laws into a successful presidential campaign. In a launch video, he spoke further of healing the nation's political divisions.\n\n\"One thing I've shown I can do, again and again, is create teams of amazingly talented people and really address these issues that are the critical issues facing this country,\" he said on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nHe also announced he was suspending his campaign with a video.\n\n\"While this campaign didn't have the outcome we were hoping for, every moment has been worthwhile and I'm thankful to everyone who supported this campaign and our entire team,\" he said in the video posted to Twitter.\nInslee became the first sitting governor to join the presidential field when he kicked off his campaign in early March.\n\nThe Washington governor is currently serving his second term in Olympia after more than two decades as a member of Congress, and said that while he is proud of efforts to raise the state's minimum wage and increase access to early childhood education, his presidential bid would prioritize climate change, which he labeled an \"existential threat\" during his launch event.\n\nOn Aug. 21, he announced on MSNBC that he was dropping out of the race.\n\n\"It's become clear that I'm not going to be carrying the ball, but we're going to make sure somebody is,\" he said in the interview.\nMiramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam\nThe little-known Florida mayor joined the growing list of 2020 presidential candidates, announcing his candidacy on March 28 despite facing an uphill climb for his bid.\n\nHe announced that he was suspending his presidential campaign on Nov. 20 in a tweet.\n\n\"I am Suspending My 2020 Presidential Campaign But I\u2019m Not Finished Yet,\" he posted on the morning of the fifth Democratic debate in Atlanta.\n\nMessam is currently the chief executive of a city of 140,000 residents -- more than the population of the city Buttigieg runs in Indiana. He is known by many Floridians for playing football for Florida State University in the 1990s.\nRep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass.\nRep. Seth Moulton, a 40-year-old Democrat from Massachusetts,  formally announced his presidential bid in April on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nMoulton, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, is known as an outspoken critic of his own party. He was elected to the House in 2013.\n\nDuring the 2018 midterms, Moulton raised more than $4 million through his Serve America PAC to support Democratic candidates running in battleground states. Before announcing his candidacy, he had already laid groundwork for his 2020 campaign, having visited Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada.\nOn Aug. 23, Moulton dropped out of the race. He told The New York Times, \"I think it's evident that this is now a three-way race between Biden, Warren and Sanders, and really it's a debate about how far the left wing party should go.\" He will seek re-election in the House to represent the 6th district of Massachusetts, according to The Times.\n\nO'Rourke announced an end to his presidential campaign via Twitter on Nov. 1.\n\n\"Our campaign has always been about seeing clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively. In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee,\" he wrote.\nHe rose national prominence during his unsuccessful run against Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 and officially announced his presidential campaign in mid-March, calling it \"a defining moment of truth for this country and for every single one of us.\"\n\nWithin days, O'Rourke's campaign announced it raised over $6.1 million in the first 24 hours following his announcement, topping Sen. Bernie Sanders' previous high-water mark of $5.9 million.\nRep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio\nThe Ohio Democrat, who announced his candidacy on ABC's \"The View\" on April 4, billed himself as someone who could unify the progressive wings of the Democratic Party with the more middle-of-the-road working-class voters.\n\nRyan, a more moderate voice in the crowded field of competitors, rose to the national political stage in 2016 when he launched a failed bid to replace Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as House minority leader. He had previously been floated as a potential candidate in the 2014 Ohio gubernatorial election.\n\nOn Oct. 24, he posted a video to announce that he was withdrawing from the presidential campaign.\n\n\"While it didn\u2019t work out quite the way we planned, this voice will not be stifled,\" Ryan said in a statement. \"I will continue to advocate and fight for the working people of this country -- white, black, brown, men, women.\"\nFormer governor and Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C.\nFormer South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford announced on Sept. 8 that he would challenge the president in the 2020 Republican primary.\n\n\"We have a storm coming that we are neither talking about nor preparing for given that we, as a country, are more financially vulnerable than we have ever been since our Nation's start and the Civil War. We are on a collision course with financial reality,\" he posted on Twitter, outlining his reasons for running.\n\nTwo months later, in November, he suspended his bid, telling reporters, \"Based on the impossibility of trying to raise the issues I\u2019ve been trying to raise which is debt, deficit, government spending in the midst of an impeachment. So call me a casualty of the impeachment process.\" He added that he felt it was impossible to get meaningful debate on anything because of partisan fighting over the impeachment inquiry process.\n\nSanford's tenure as South Carolina governor was rocked by scandal in 2009 after he secretly traveled to Argentina to meet with his lover, Buenos Aires resident Maria Belen Chapur. He confessed to having an extramarital affair in a news conference after his return. He finished his term as governor and was elected to Congress several years later.\n\nFormer Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa.\nSestak, a former Pennsylvania congressman and a retired three-star admiral in the U.S. Navy, dropped out of the race on Dec. 1. He entered the field at the onset of the first presidential debates in June, despite never qualifying for one.\n\n\"I know there is a tear in that fabric right now; but it can be repaired by someone who can lead, and therefore unite, all Americans,\" Sestak wrote in a Twitter post announcing the end of his candidacy.\n\nSestak began his career in the Navy in 1974, before becoming the highest-ranking military officer ever elected to Congress in 2007, according to his campaign website. He served in the House until 2011.\n\nIn 2016, he competed in the Democratic primary to unseat Sen. Pat Toomey in a tough battleground race but was defeated by Democratic rival Katie McGinty.\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.\nThe California congressman and vocal critic of the president, Swalwell officially launched his bid for the Democratic nomination on April 8. Swalwell, who stopped in several early-voting states during the leadup to his announcement, was rooting his campaign's agenda in the issue of gun control. Following his formal announcement, he held a town hall in Sunrise, Florida, with Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students and families.\n\"I'm telling folks, keep your rifles, keep your shotguns, keep your pistols, we just want the most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous people,\" Swalwell told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on \"Good Morning America\" on April 9. \"Most gun owners believe that.\"\n\nOn July 8, he became the first of the more than 20 Democratic nominees to drop out of the race.\n\n\"I ran for President to win and make a difference in our great country,\" Swalwell wrote in a news release. \"I promised my family, constituents, and supporters that I would always be honest about our chances. After the first Democratic presidential debate, our polling and fundraising numbers weren't what we had hoped for, and I no longer see a path forward to the nomination.\""}
