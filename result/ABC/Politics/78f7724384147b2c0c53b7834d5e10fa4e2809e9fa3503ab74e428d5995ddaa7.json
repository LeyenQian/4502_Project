In his report, Horowitz asserted that the FBI decision to surveil Page was legal.\n\u201cWe did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBI's decision to seek [surveillance] on Carter Page,\u201d Horowitz wrote.\n\nBut the president and his allies have called it \"a major SPY scandal\" and accused those involved of working on behalf of the \"Deep State.\" Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 23, 2018 Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!\nWray did not respond directly to the president, but pushed back on the \"Deep State\" characterization of the bureau's work.\n\n\"I think that's the kind of label that's a disservice to the men and women who work at the FBI who I think tackle their jobs with professionalism, with rigor, with objectivity, with courage,\" Wray said. \"So that's not a term I would ever use to describe our work force and I think it's an affront to them.\"\nHorowitz's report described a series of major errors and omissions related to the surveillance application targeting a former Trump campaign aide that \"made it appear that the information supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case.\"\n\n\"In my view, every error and omission is significant and it's something we need to take seriously,\" Wray told ABC News.\nThe president and his allies have long alleged that the Trump campaign was illegally spied on, aggressively accusing both the Obama administration and the FBI of carrying out what Trump has called \"one of the biggest political scandals in history.\"\n\nAsked whether he thought the FBI unfairly targeted the Trump campaign, Wray offered a blunt assessment: \"I do not.\"\nAttorney General William Barr made headlines in April 2019 when he told a Senate panel that \"spying did occur\" on the Trump campaign, adding there was a need to \"explore\" whether the probe was \"adequately predicated.\" Wray has previously said \"spying\" is \"not a term I would use,\" and on Monday reiterated that point.\n\"Again, different people have different colloquial terms,\" he said, \" but we use terms like \u2018investigation' and \u2018surveillance.'\"\n\nWray also pushed back on a widely debunked theory put forth by the president and his allies that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election \u2013 and sounded the alarm on the Kremlin\u2019s plans for the 2020 cycle.\n\n\u201cWe have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election,\u201d Wray said, adding that \u201cas far as the [2020] election itself goes, we think Russia represents the most significant threat.\u201d\n\nWray took over the FBI's top spot in August 2017, months after James Comey's dismissal from the position. After releasing his report Monday, Horowitz is expected to face lawmakers on Wednesday in a public hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nABC News' Jack Date, Alex Mallin, Luke Barr, and Olivia Rubin contributed reporting."}
