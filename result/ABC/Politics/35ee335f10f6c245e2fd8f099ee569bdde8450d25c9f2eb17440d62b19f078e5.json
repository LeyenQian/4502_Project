Doug Collins, R-Ga., and other Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee from Wednesday\u2019s impeachment hearing with constitutional law scholars.\n\u201cAs a Catholic I resent your using the word hate in the sentence that addresses me. I don't hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love and always pray for the president,\u201d she said.A reporter asks Nancy Pelosi if she \"hates the president.\"\"I don't hate anybody,\" she says in a strong response. \"As a Catholic, I resent your using the word hate in a sentence that addresses me...Don't mess with me when it comes to words like that.\" https://t.co/bsfJRKZ0IN pic.twitter.com/DfSs9d2T33\u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 5, 2019\n\n   A reporter asks Nancy Pelosi if she \"hates the president.\"\"I don't hate anybody,\" she says in a strong response. \"As a Catholic, I resent your using the word hate in a sentence that addresses me...Don't mess with me when it comes to words like that.\" https://t.co/bsfJRKZ0IN pic.twitter.com/DfSs9d2T33\n\u201cI still pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time. So don't mess with me when it comes to words like that.\u201d\nDemocrats\u2019 three witnesses in Wednesday\u2019s hearing said Trump abused his office in seeking to pressure Ukraine to launch political investigations. Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University Law School professor and Republicans\u2019 sole witness, argued that Democrats were rushing to impeach Trump prematurely and should continue to investigate and litigate disputes with the executive branch over evidence and testimony in court.\n\nPelosi said that Trump, in spurning congressional subpoenas and directing current and former aides not to cooperate with House committees, has obstructed their investigations. \n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be accomplices to it,\u201d she said.\nThe California Democrat, who had previously warned that impeachment could polarize and divide the country, defended the decision Thursday to move forward.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one who is dividing the country on this. We\u2019re honoring our oaths of office,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think the president is a coward when it comes to helping our kids who are afraid of gun violence. I think he is cruel when he doesn't deal with helping our dreamers of which we're very proud. I think he is in denial about the climate crisis,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHowever, that is about the election,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is about the Constitution of the United States and the facts that lead to the president's violation of his oath of office.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump tweeted about her testy exchange with the reporter.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi just had a nervous fit. She hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more. Stock Market and employment records. She says she \u201cprays for the President.\u201d I don\u2019t believe her, not even close. Help the homeless in your district Nancy. USMCA?\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, the House Judiciary Committee will meet to hear evidence presented by The House Intelligence Committee staff that compiled the 300-page Ukraine report. It\u2019s not clear if the White House will participate in the upcoming hearing.\n"}
