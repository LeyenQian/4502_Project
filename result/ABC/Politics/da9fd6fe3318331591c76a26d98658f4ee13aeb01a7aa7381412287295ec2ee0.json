Rather, the department's inspector general exonerated FBI leadership of the president's accusations they were engaged in a conspiracy to sabotage his campaign.\nDespite the findings, Trump labeled the investigation an \"attempted overthrow\" of the government.\n\n\"It was concocted, and you say what you want, that was probably something that's never happened in the history of our country,\" Trump said.\nIn an exclusive broadcast interview with ABC Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas, FBI Director Chris Wray said he did not think the agency had treated the Trump campaign unfairly. .@PierreTABC to @GStephanopoulos on his interview with Chris Wray: \"I asked the FBI director point blank if he thought that the FBI had treated the Trump campaign unfairly. He said, 'I do not.'\" https://t.co/YXkEJN2rj6 pic.twitter.com/qsqy12wi5R\u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 9, 2019\n.@PierreTABC to @GStephanopoulos on his interview with Chris Wray: \"I asked the FBI director point blank if he thought that the FBI had treated the Trump campaign unfairly.
