Both were also reacting in ways that might have been harder to comprehend if not for Trump.\nThere's an element in the impeachment push being led by Pelosi that argues that this president has earned a particular type of tone in addition to a specific rebuke. It may also be that Biden's response was understandable, given the personal nature of Trump's allegations.\n\nWhat Democrats cannot and do not know is whether anger will be rewarded by voters when it counts. Maybe voters want street fighters pushing for impeachment, or vying for the Democratic nomination to go up against Trump.\n\nHowever that is answered, Trump's dominance of the political conversation extends clearly into subject matter as well as tone. That's been a net positive for him earlier in his still-young political career.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nDemocrats are demanding answers to why and how exactly a boy died of the flu while in U.S. government custody last spring.\n\nNew heart-breaking and shocking video, obtained by ProPublica, appears to show the child suffering for hours on the floor of a detention center, before he died and was found by his roommate, a fellow minor at the center.\n\nChairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Karen Bass, said the death of 16-year-old, Guatemala native Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez amounted to \"state-sponsored child abuse\" and \"negligent homicide.\"\nThe video seems a direct counter to what the public was first told -- that the boy had been checked on and was found unresponsive by authorities. Now there are urgent questions about whether initial accounts from law enforcement were intentionally misleading and whether evidence from the center could even have been manipulated to try and cover up negligence in the case.\n\nDemocrats from the House Homeland Security Committee tweeted Thursday, \"The inconsistencies between Border Patrol's official account and this video regarding the death of a migrant child is disturbing. We need answers from Border Patrol on why their account doesn't match up with this video.\"\n\nVasquez was one of seven minors since early 2018 who were known to die after being in U.S. custody. The big questions now: Will the administration also seek answers? Will anyone be held accountable? And will conditions change?\n\nThe TIP with John Verhovek\n\nBiden is hoping for a boost in Iowa from a familiar face who has a comeback story of his own in the Hawkeye State: former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. He overcame lagging early poll numbers to win the 2004 caucuses.\n\nKerry endorsed Biden on Thursday, calling him \"the candidate with the wisdom and standing to fix what Trump has broken.\" On Friday, he will join the former vice president on his \"No Malarkey\" bus tour through Iowa.\n\nThe similarities between Biden and Kerry's candidacies, including a much-needed Iowa comeback, were not lost on the former vice president when he was asked about the endorsement and the 2004 campaign.\n\n\"I hope it plays out the same way in Iowa,\" Biden told ABC News in New Hampton, Iowa.\nONE MORE THING\n\nAs impeachment drama marches forward in Washington, D.C., focusing on a call between President Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine, Rudy Giuliani traveled to Kyiv.
