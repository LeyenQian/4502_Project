{"Title": "Trump doesn't know why Giuliani spoke with OMB", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-giuliani-spoke-omb-67489490", "Article": "\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday dismissed the significance of repeated contacts between his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and phone numbers linked to the White House and its budget office \u2014 contacts that were first revealed in a House Intelligence Committee impeachment report released earlier this week.\n\"So somebody said he made a phone call into the White House. What difference does that make?\u201d Trump said to reporters during a meeting with Italy's prime minister on the sidelines of a NATO meeting outside of London.\n\u201cIs that supposed to be a big deal?'\" he added. \"I don\u2019t think so.\"\nThe 300-page report laying out the case against Trump is serving as the basis for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry:         House Judiciary Committee hearings that are expected to precede the drafting of formal articles of impeachment against him. On Wednesday, the committee heard from law professors who discussed the constitutional origins of Congress\u2019 impeachment power and debated whether Trump committed an impeachable offense when he asked the president of Ukraine to investigate a Democratic political rival and potentially held up critical security aid to pressure him.\nThe report, which was made public Tuesday, includes a summary of phone records obtained by the committee showing extensive contact between Giuliani and the White House, as well as a caller identified only as \u201c-1.\u201d\nOn April 24, for instance, Giuliani spoke three times with a number linked to the Office of Management and Budget \u2014 the office that delayed the release of hundreds of millions in earmarked Ukrainian aid money \u2014 and he spoke eight times with a number linked to the White House, the documents show.\nLater that night, the State Department phoned then-Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and abruptly called her home from Kyiv because of \u201cconcerns\u201d from \u201cup the street\u201d at the White House.\nThe release of the phone logs in the report sparked search efforts at the White House and in the budget office to try to track down who had been in touch with Giuliani, to no apparent avail.\nOMB officials told The Associated Press that a staff review showed that nobody there has ever spoken to Giuliani. White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney still uses the cellphone he had when he ran the budget office, leading some to suspect that he may be the holder of the \u201cOMB Phone Number.\u201d But a senior White House official said a review of his cellphone records did not turn up any calls between Mulvaney and Giuliani on the days cited in the report. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal records.\nMeanwhile, Trump on Wednesday insisted he knew nothing about the calls, even as he maintained they were \u201cno big deal.\u201d He also defended Giuliani as a \u201cvery good lawyer,\u201d a \u201cgreat crime fighter\u201d and \u201cthe best mayor in the history of New York City.\u201d\n\u201cRudy is a great gentleman and they\u2019re after him only because he\u2019s done such a good job. He was very effective against Mueller and the Mueller hoax,\u201d Trump said, referring to former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\nGiuliani, too, weighed in by tweet.\n\u201cThe mere fact I had numerous calls with the White House does not establish any specific topic,\" he wrote, adding: \u201cRemember, I\u2019m the President\u2019s attorney.\u201d The White House has a full legal office that handles official matters.\nGiuliani has long pushed the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election and is accused of trying to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump\u2019s potential Democratic challenger Joe Biden. Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, when his father worked at the White House.\nThe phone records released Tuesday also raised new questions about the role of California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. Nunes, the records show, had a series of calls with Giuliani, as well as with Giuliani's now-indicted associate Lev Parnas. One conversation with Parnas on April 12 lasted eight minutes, according to call logs. \nNunes told Fox News host Sean Hannity that \u201cit's possible\u201d he talked to Parnas, but claimed he wasn't sure because he hadn't gone through all his phone records.\n\u201cI don't really recall that name. I remember the name now because he has been indicted,\u2019\u2019 Nunes said, adding that any conversation with Parnas would have been appropriate. \nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., meanwhile, defended Nunes on Wednesday, saying that, \u201cDevin can talk to anybody he wants to talk to.\u201d\nAsked if Nunes should have told House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff about his conversations with people under investigation, McCarthy instead criticized Schiff for his office's communication with the whistle blower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Watford, England and Matthew Daly, Darlene Superville and Alan Fram in Washington contributed to this report."}
