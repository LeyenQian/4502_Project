But the meeting led by Mulvaney is akin to being called into the principal\u2019s office in a bid to resolve their long-running dispute that several people say has grown increasingly ugly.\nThe administration source said that Azar and Verma have been told previously, in separate settings, to knock it off. The president, the vice president, and the vice president's chief of staff have also all previously relayed the same message, the official said.\n\nSources familiar with the feud tell ABC News that Azar and Verma have been at odds over the direction of health care policy under Trump, who campaigned on a promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. Now, both are vying for a green light from the White House to move ahead with their ideas and sway national policy.\nAn HHS spokesperson said in a statement the two are working together and have made progress on key issues like pricing transparency.\n\u201cSecretary Azar\u2019s and Administrator Verma\u2019s top priority is to advance the President\u2019s healthcare agenda through lowering drug costs, advancing competition in the marketplace, and ensuring Americans have access to high quality, affordable healthcare,\u201d an HHS spokesperson said in a statement released to the press.\nMulvaney's office declined to comment.\n\nVerma -- a former health care consultant from Indiana -- arrived at HHS as CMS chief at the start of the administration with close ties to Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nAzar didn\u2019t take the helm of HHS until after Trump\u2019s first health secretary, Tom Price, resigned. And as a former pharmaceutical executive who worked as a top health official during the George W. Bush administration, Azar is seen by some as more of an outsider than Verma, although he is considered to have a close working relationship with Pence as well.\n\nAs Azar and Verma sparred internally on health care, Politico reported that Verma had spent more than $2 million in a one-year public relations contract that was aimed at raising her public profile. An internal watchdog office at HHS has confirmed it\u2019s investigating the contracts upon a request by House Democrats.\nThis past weekend, Politico reported a lost property claim filed by Verma in August 2018 with HHS after items she was traveling with were stolen from her luggage during a work-related trip. According to documents obtained by Politico under the Freedom of Information Act, the form listed $47,000 in jewelry and other property, including a $5,900 Ivanka Trump-brand pendant. She was reimbursed by the federal agency for $2,852.\n\nA spokesperson for Verma said she first inquired about recovering the loss with her own insurance company but was told to file a claim through her employer because the items were stolen during a work trip. The law allows federal employees to file claims for stolen property while on duty. The spokesman also said the administrator was instructed to include a \u201cfull inventory\u201d of all items in her luggage.\n\n\u201cAt her own expense the Administrator travels to Washington, DC from Indiana each week to work at CMS, which was why she was traveling with her personal collection of jewelry,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nThe CMS spokesman attributed the leaks to a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against Verma\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cThese recent leaks and gossip are part of a targeted campaign to smear the Administrator and undermine the accomplishments of CMS and the Administration,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe Administrator\u2019s number one priority is continuing to deliver on the President\u2019s bold healthcare agenda to ensure Americans have access to high quality, affordable health care.\u201d\n\nAt least one House Democrat, Rep. Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, has called for her resignation in the wake of both her filed claim on the lost jewelry and steering more than $2 million to public relations contracts.\n\n\u201cWe have now seen a systemic effort by the administrator to use public funds to elevate her own position,\u201d Kennedy told Politico.\n\nABC News\u2019 John Santucci, Olivia Rubin and Laura Romero contributed to this report.\n\n\n___"}
