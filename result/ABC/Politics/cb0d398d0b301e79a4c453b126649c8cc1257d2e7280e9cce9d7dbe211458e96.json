But it enabled both sides to present their findings to the American public through a political lens one final time before lawmakers vote on articles of impeachment.\nDemocratic counsel Dan Goldman said Trump was engaged in a \u201cpersistent and continuing effort\u201d to coerce a foreign government to \u201chelp him cheat to win an election,\u201d making him a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to U.S. elections and national security.\nRepublican counsel Stephen Castor said nothing the president has done rises to the level of impeachment and accused Democrats of \u201csearching for a set of facts\u201d they could use to discredit the president since he was elected.\nThe hearing grew testy as opposing legal counsel were allowed to question one another, and Republicans repeatedly interjected with procedural objections.\n\nIn one particularly heated exchange, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, demanded details from Democratic counsel Goldman about the Democrats\u2019 subpoena of phone records.\n\n\u201cWho ordered it? Was it you?\u201d said Collins, questioning whether the records were added to the final impeachment report for \u201csmear purposes.\u201d\nGoldman replied that his question would be better directed as Trump allies involved in the \u201cscheme\u201d to pressure Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI am going to go on record and tell you I'm not going to reveal how we conducted this investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nGoldman did acknowledge though that the committee issued \u201cat least four\u201d subpoenas to Verizon and AT&T, but said none of them specifically targeted members of Congress.\n\nRepublican counsel Castor testified that he was aware of six subpoenas issued by the Democrats that targeted Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani; an associate of Giuliani\u2019s, Igor Fruman, who faces campaign finance charges; and Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nIncluded in the phone log is a call between Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and Lev Parnas, who also faces federal charges on campaign violations. Nunes told Fox News earlier this month that he\u2019s never met Parnas and couldn\u2019t recall talking with him on the phone.\nFor President Richard Nixon and Watergate, the million dollar question was \u201cWhat did the president know and when did he know it?\u201d And President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment is mostly remembered for Clinton\u2019s famous denial of an extra-marital affair with a White House intern: \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman.\u201d\n\nCollins tried to make the point that there was so little evidence of Trump\u2019s wrongdoing that Americans wouldn\u2019t able to come away with a single, memorable line for Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry. He said perhaps the only big takeaway line is \u201cwhere is the impeachable offense?\u201d\n\nPennsylvania Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon later told reporters she thought Americans would remember Trump\u2019s words to Ukraine\u2019s president in his July 25 phone call: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d Trump used the phrase in response to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanking Trump for U.S. military support and asking about \u201cnext steps.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question,\u201d Scanlon said of Americans remembering the line, which was repeatedly referenced by Democrats throughout the hearing.\n\nThe White House decided against cooperating with the inquiry, repeatedly calling it a sham and refusing to provide documents or testimony.\n\nLate Friday afternoon, White House counsel Pat Cipollone signaled that Trump wouldn\u2019t be sending legal representation on Monday, quoting Trump on the effort: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business.\u201d\n\nBut the refusal to cooperate also limited the GOP ability to directly tackle the Democratic argument that Trump was engaged in historic stonewalling of Congress and should face impeachment articles on obstruction.\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted and retweeted repeatedly, touting the economy, calling the inquiry a \u201cWitch Hunt!\u201d and urging his supporters to \u201cRead the Transcripts!\u201d\nTrump later told reporters that he did watch some of the hearing.\n\n\"Very little. It's a disgrace. It's a disgrace to our country. It's a hoax, and it should never, ever be allowed to happen again,\" he said.\n\nABC News\u2019 Benjamin Siegel, Liz Aleese and Katherine Faulders contributed to this report.\n"}
