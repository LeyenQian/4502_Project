They\u2019re very powerful. They\u2019re very strong,\" Pelosi said as the Judiciary Committee was debating the wording of the articles alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nThe debate came ahead of an expected final vote Thursday to send them to the House for final votes next week.\n\nAsked why no specific crime such as bribery was included -- a charge Pelosi herself has leveled against the president -- she answered, \"I, myself, am not a lawyer, although sometimes I act like one,\" saying that she had left the matter up to the committee chairs and legal counsel.\n\n\"The president is wrong,\" Pelosi said flatly, responding to his calling this \"impeachment lite.\"\n\"Nothing swift about it, but it is urgent,\" Pelosi said, about the speed of the Democrats' impeachment effort, saying six committees have been working on the impeachment investigation \"for a long time.\"\n\nDemocrats argue Trump poses a \"clear and present danger\" to American democracy because, unless he's stopped, they say, he might try to \"cheat\" again in next November's election.\n\nAsked by ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce what message she had for moderate Democrats worried a vote for impeachment might hurt them politically, Pelosi said she would not try to persuade them -- including ones elected in districts that voted for Trump in 2016.\n\n\"I have no message to them. We are not whipping this legislation,\" she said, \"nor do we ever whip something like this. People have to come to their own conclusions.\"\"I have no message to them ... people have to come to their own conclusions,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi tells ABC News' @marykbruce when asked what her message is to moderate Democrats who are concerned that a vote for impeachment could hurt them politically. https://t.co/l8K4Z1nnsy pic.twitter.com/MUh9Wt08oq\u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 12, 2019\n\n   \"I have no message to them ... people have to come to their own conclusions,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi tells ABC News' @marykbruce when asked what her message is to moderate Democrats who are concerned that a vote for impeachment could hurt them politically. https://t.co/l8K4Z1nnsy pic.twitter.com/MUh9Wt08oq\n\"They\u2019ve seen the facts as presented in the Intelligence Committee \u2013 they\u2019ve seen the Constitution, they know it \u2013 they take an oath to protect and defend it.

I don\u2019t say anything to them,\" she said.\n\n\"The facts are irrefutable,\" she said. \"The fact is we take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy used his weekly press conference to rail against Democrats, saying they\u2019ve been determined to impeach Trump since he took office.\n\nHe said if Republicans were in the majority, they would \u201cnot use our power simply for the sake of dislike of another individual.\u201d\n\nHe added that the impeachment process has \u201cweakened the office of the president\u201d and the idea of democracy.\n\n\u201cI wish they would take one pause and think as an American, what does it do to the country?\u201d he said.\n\nOn the upcoming Senate trial, McCarthy said he is not concerned.\n\n\u201cIf it goes over to the Senate I don\u2019t think it should have to last that long because there are no facts there to uphold impeachment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe articles they have, I don\u2019t think stand on any merit,\u201d he said.\n"}
