Dershowitz was a member of a star legal team that represented Epstein during his multiple investigations beginning in the mid 2000s.\nVirginia Roberts Giuffre has alleged in courts documents that she was lent out to Dershowitz for sex by Epstein. Dershowitz has vehemently denied those accusations.\n\nAs the White House sets its sights on an impeachment trial, questions have mounted about who would lead the president's defense.\nOne of the president's personal attorneys, Rudy Giuliani, is a focus of the impeachment probe and work he did as it relates to Ukraine. Separately, Giuliani's relationship with two Ukraine-born men -- Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were indicted this fall by federal prosecutors -- is the subject of a criminal investigation in the Southern District of New York, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nIn an op-ed published earlier this week, Dershowitz wrote that the two articles of impeachment proposed by the House Judiciary committee failed to meet the standard in his opinion. \"Both are so vague and open ended that they could be applied in partisan fashion by a majority of the House against almost any president from the opposing party.\"\n\nDershowitz, a longtime professor at Harvard University, most notably won the appeal of Claus von B\u00fclow's 1982 conviction for the attempted murder of his wife, Sunny. He was also part of the legal \"Dream Team\" for O.J. Simpson's murder trial.\n"}
