However, a separate spending bill will be required to fund the policy items listed in the NDAA.Wow! All of our priorities have made it into the final NDAA: Pay Raise for our Troops, Rebuilding our Military, Paid Parental Leave, Border Security, and Space Force! Congress \u2013 don\u2019t delay this anymore! I will sign this historic defense legislation immediately!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 11, 2019 Wow! All of our priorities have made it into the final NDAA: Pay Raise for our Troops, Rebuilding our Military, Paid Parental Leave, Border Security, and Space Force! Congress \u2013 don\u2019t delay this anymore! I will sign this historic defense legislation immediately!\nPresident Donald Trump touted the bill as a success on Wednesday ahead of the House vote, tweeting that he would sign it \"immediately.\"\nHere are some of the items included in this year's NDAA:\n\nThe NDAA will establish the U.S. Space Force as the sixth armed service, joining the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. It will be housed under the Air Force in a similar manner as to how the Marine Corps is a part of the Navy.\nA congressional logjam on the bill was removed late last week after Democrats secured an agreement for paid leave in return for support for the creation of Space Force, a key initiative of the Trump administration.\n\nThe defense bill will provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave for all federal civilian employees in the event of birth or adoption of a child.\n\u201cIncluding paid family leave is a victory for all workers because it will help push more employers in the right direction and ensure more workers get paid family leave,\" said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., in a statement on Monday. \"Expanding access to paid family leave helps the health and economic well-being of individuals who have it and strengthens the ability of employers to retain their workers.\u201d\nThe NDAA implements reforms to privatized military housing, the most substantial overhaul to the system since it was created in 1996.\n\n\"These reforms address the considerable gaps in oversight and accountability seen at all levels of housing management from ineffective housing offices, to substandard property management, to under-engaged military leadership,\" a summary of the NDAA conference agreement said.\nThe state of privatized military housing was thrust into the spotlight following news reports that revealed issues with mold, lead paint and vermin at military installations across the country.\n\nThe NDAA also requires that the services establish a Tenant Bill of Rights.\n\nThe NDAA increased security assistance funding to Ukraine to $300 million to include lethal defense weapons.\nThe $250 million in aid authorized last year became the center of the impeachment proceedings against the president after it was revealed that the White House had blocked the flow of aid in order to pressure the Ukrainian government into opening a probe into former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.\n\nThe NDAA includes $5.3 billion in emergency disaster recovery funding to help military installations affected by extreme weather and natural disasters, the re-authorization of the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program and a prohibition on the use of firefighting foam containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) after October 2024.\n\nIt also has legislation named after Otto Warmbier, the American college student who died after being held in North Korean custody, that expands mandatory sanctions on foreign banks and companies facilitating illicit transactions with Pyongyang. Warmbier's family had actively lobbied for the legislation.\nThe NDAA did not include an amendment that would have ended the Trump administration's ban on transgender service members. The amendment, which was approved by the House in a 242 to 187 vote, also would have codified non-discrimination in the armed forces.\n\nThe bill also excludes two key foreign policy provisions that the House had passed to push back against the president's fierce defense of Saudi Arabia.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted on U.S. support for the Saudi and United Arab Emirates coalition's fight against Houthi rebels in Yemen -- vetoing both a series of resolutions to block arms sales to the two countries and a historic War Powers resolution to withdraw U.S. military support for the coalition.\nIn the face of those vetoes, the House passed a measure to block futures arms sales to the coalition. But during negotiations on the final text, it was stripped from the NDAA, prompting some progressive lawmakers to call for the bill to be vetoed, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.\n\nThe final legislation also waters down a measure passed overwhelmingly by the House in a 405 to 7 vote to require the Director of National Intelligence to issue a report on which Saudi officials are responsible for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and issue sanctions.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has assessed that likely includes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS -- something the Trump administration has so far denied.\nInstead, the bill will only require the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to issue a report, leaving it in the administration's hands to take action afterwards. This is something they have refused to do thus far, beyond adopting the Saudi narrative of a rogue operation and punishing nearly all the same officials that the Saudis have.\n\n\"Congress clearly bent to the will of the White House in dropping NDAA provisions that would have sanctioned Khashoggi's murderers and limited support to Saudi Arabia's air war in Yemen,\" said Rob Berschinski, senior vice president of Human Rights First. \"After talking a strong game, Congress essentially allowed MBS a free pass. The reason, it seems, is that Congressional Republicans ultimately don\u2019t want to run afoul of Trump, and Trump supports MBS categorically.\"\n\nABC New's Luis Martinez contributed to this report from the Pentagon."}
