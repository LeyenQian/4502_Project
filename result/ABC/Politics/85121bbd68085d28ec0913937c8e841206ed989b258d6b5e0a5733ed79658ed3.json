Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.\"So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill! https://t.co/M8ZtS8okzE\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2019 So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill! https://t.co/M8ZtS8okzE\nLater Thursday, a verified Twitter account managed by the Trump 2020 campaign tweeted a doctored cover of Time's 2019 Person of the Year cover -- with Trump's head photoshopped onto Thunberg's body.When it comes to keeping his promises, there's only one Person Of The Year: \u2705Booming Economy\u2705Record Job Creation\u2705Historic Tax Cuts\u2705#AmericaFirst Trade Deals\u2705ISIS Destroyed\u2705Building the Wall#TIMEPOY #PromisesMadePromisesKept pic.twitter.com/bEt9yqInqY\u2014 Trump War Room (Text TRUMP to 88022) (@TrumpWarRoom) December 12, 2019 When it comes to keeping his promises, there's only one Person Of The Year: \u2705Booming Economy\u2705Record Job Creation\u2705Historic Tax Cuts\u2705#AmericaFirst Trade Deals\u2705ISIS Destroyed\u2705Building the Wall#TIMEPOY #PromisesMadePromisesKept pic.twitter.com/bEt9yqInqY\nBoth tweets come one day after Time magazine's announcement of Thunberg as Person of the Year, which represents the person or group, idea or object, that \"most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year, for better or for worse.\"\n\nTime Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal said while making the announcement that Thunberg \"represents a broader generational shift in the culture that we're seeing from the campuses of Hong Kong to the protests in Chile to Parkland, Florida, where the students marched against gun violence, where young people are demanding change urgently.\"\n\nThe president was a finalist for the title this year and has demonstrated a persistent interest in who gets the titled each year. He was selected as Person of the Year in 2016.\nThis is not the first time the president has gone after Thunberg on Twitter -- and not the first time she's acknowledged it on the platform.\n\n\"She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\" Trump tweeted in September after Thunberg gave a fiery speech at the United Nations General Assembly criticizing world leaders for inaction on climate changeShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.
