Joni Ernst has worked closely with the Iowa Republican to raise money and boost her reelection prospects, a degree of overlap that potentially violates the law, documents obtained by The Associated Press show. \nIowa Values, a political nonprofit that is supposed to be run independently, was co-founded in 2017 by Ernst's longtime consultant, Jon Kohan. It shares a fundraiser, Claire Holloway Avella, with the Ernst campaign. And a condo owned by a former aide \u2014 who was recently hired to lead the group \u2014 was used as Iowa Values' address at a time when he worked for her. \nPolitical nonprofits are often referred to as \u201cdark money\u201d groups because they can raise unlimited sums and are not required to reveal their donors. But they must take steps to keep their activities separate from the candidates they support. Additionally, while such tax-exempt groups can do political work, they can\u2019t make it their primary purpose. \nThe documents reviewed by the AP, including emails and         a strategy memo, not only make clear that the group\u2019s aim is securing an Ernst win in 2020, but they also show Ernst and her campaign worked in close concert with Iowa Values. \nErnst is hardly the first politician to push campaign finance law boundaries. But the revelation could complicate her efforts to fend off a Democratic challenger in a closely watched race next year. \n\u201cThe truth is, our campaign is completely separate and independent from any outside organization,\" Ernst senior adviser Brook Ramlet said in a statement. \u201cOur campaign always has and always will act in full compliance with and in the spirit of the law. For the AP to suggest otherwise, is the definition of fake news.\u201d\nCampaign finance law states that candidates and their \u201cagents\u201d can't solicit, direct or spend contributions that exceed federal limits, even if the donations are made to an outside group. Those limits currently prevent donors from giving more than $2,800 to a candidate and $5,000 to a political action committee per election. \nIn July, Holloway Avella requested \u201can investment of $50,000\u201d from a donor after Ernst made an introduction. She made clear in an email, which was obtained by the AP, how much a contribution of that size could help. \n\u201cAs a follow up to our introduction by Senator Ernst, I am reaching out to you on behalf of Iowa Values,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cAs you may have seen, an outside group on the left ... recently launched a six-figure ad buy in media markets across the state attacking Senator Ernst on her vote to repeal Obamacare,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe purpose of our group, Iowa Values, is to push back against these type of negative attacks.\u201d \nSeparately, a strategy memo states the group will use door-knocking, as well as TV, radio and digital advertising, to build a \u201cfirewall\u201d that could be the difference \u201cbetween winning and losing in 2020 for Senator Ernst.\u201d The group is targeting about 120,000 Iowans who \u201clean Republican on the issues\u201d but abandon the party at times over \u201cthe tone of the GOP.\u201d\nTaken together, some legal experts say the documents offer proof that the effort violates the spirit of campaign finance and tax law, if not the letter of it. \n\u201cIt seems like pretty strong evidence\u201d that the $50,000 request was for an \u201cillegal donation\u201d while it's \u201cclear that the goal of Iowa Values is to reelect Joni Ernst, which may violate its tax-exempt status,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, an attorney with the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center in Washington.\nHe also said the documents pulled back the curtain on how dark money works. \n\u201cThis is a striking example of how secret campaign money operates,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cThe big donors that bankroll a dark money group like Iowa Values remain hidden from the public, but the politician that benefits knows where the money is coming from.\u201d \nStill, it\u2019s far from certain that the Federal Election Commission, or the IRS, will find that they broke the law. \nThe FEC often gridlocks along partisan lines. And after a recent resignation, the panel doesn\u2019t have enough members to legally meet for conducting business. Similarly, the IRS has shown little appetite for cracking down on dark money groups that push the limits. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a real disconnect between the principles behind the law and how they are enforced,\u201d said Larry Noble, a former general counsel to the FEC who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Noble said he would need more details before assessing whether Ernst\u2019s campaign broke the law. But, he added: \u201cThe bottom line is that this is really questionable.\u201d \nDan Petalas,  a former acting general counsel at the FEC, said that the \u201claw is undecided\u201d but that his personal view is the fundraising was permissible because Holloway Avella said she was requesting the $50,000 on behalf of Iowa Values, not the campaign.\nIn a statement, Iowa Values executive director Derek Flowers said the organization has \u201csystems and controls in place to make certain that it complies with all laws\u201d and is \u201ccareful to follow all requirements that limit how much of its activities can be focused on supporting candidates.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s undeniable is the close connection between Ernst and the group. \nKohan, a former Ernst deputy chief of staff who is now a general consultant to her campaign, was paid $120,000 to serve as executive director of Iowa Values for two years, according to the group's tax filings. He left the group earlier this year. Jamestown Associates, where he is a named partner, also collected an additional $101,000 from Ernst\u2019s campaign in the years he served as executive director. \nHolloway Avella raised about $520,000 for Iowa Values in         2017 and         2018, tax records show. The group lists her Arlington, Virginia, office as one of its business addresses and paid her about $60,000. Ernst paid her an additional $363,000 those years, record show. \nThe group listed a Waukee, Iowa, condo owned by Flowers as another business address in 2017, records show. Flowers was campaign manager during Ernst\u2019s 2014 Senate primary. A company called Midland Strategies, which has been paid $145,000 by Ernst since 2013, also listed Flowers\u2019 condo as a business address. Flowers succeeded Kohan as the group's executive director this year.\nAfter Ernst launched her reelection campaign, Holloway Avella was deeply involved with both operations. \nHolloway Avella's website lets prospective donors request to host a fundraiser for the senator. And invitations for several recent Ernst events list her as an organizer, including two held in September at Bistro Bis, a French eatery a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol. \nAround the same time, Holloway Avella was seeking donations for Iowa Values from prominent Ernst supporters, like dieting entrepreneur Jenny Craig and San Francisco philanthropist Diane \u201cDede\u201d Wilsey. Craig previously gave $30,000 to Ernst; Wilsey donated $46,000. \nA         legal compliance letter Holloway Avella sent to donors underscored the delicate terrain. \nIowa Values\u2019 mission \u201cis to educate the public about common-sense solutions to various public policy issues of national importance,\u201d it stated. \u201cIt was not formed by any federal candidates or agents of candidates or at the direction or request of any candidates or an agent of a candidate.\u201d"}
