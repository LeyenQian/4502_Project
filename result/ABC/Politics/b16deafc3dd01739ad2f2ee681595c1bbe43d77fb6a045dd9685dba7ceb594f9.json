Black people were vibing with [Biden], in a way.\"\nHowever, Dyson also referred back to the June Democratic debates, when Sen. Kamala Harris called out Biden for his record on race, specifically with regard to forced school busing.\n\nBiden seems to be going through \"the typical experience of a white guy trying to grapple with race in America,\" Dyson said, adding that it's \"a very mixed bag going on there.\"\nButtigieg, meanwhile, hasn't received the same support from black Americans. Dyson argues that he could still \"overcome\" that deficit in potential votes.\n\n\"What I like about him though, is the fact that when he was scathingly rebuked by a black reporter, he picked up the phone and called him,\" Dyson said of Buttigieg's phone call with \"The Root\" writer Michael Harriot regarding an article he wrote claiming the candidate is a liar. \"[Pete Buttigieg] engaged that.\"\n\nDyson also raised the issue that less than 3% of business contracts in South Bend went to minority- and female-owned businesses.\n\n\"It's not just a physical, psychological thing; it's also structural,\" Dyson said. \"What is the money distribution like? How are you making justice a reality in terms of who you're giving money to?\"\n\n\"Having said that, I do like his openness,\" Dyson said. \"I like his ability to be self-critical and introspective.\"\n\nEvery episode of ABC's award-winning talk show \"The View\" is now available as a podcast!
