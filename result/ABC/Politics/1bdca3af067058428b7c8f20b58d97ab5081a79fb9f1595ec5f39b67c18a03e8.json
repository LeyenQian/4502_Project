In its lawsuit, the ACLU asserts, however, that the evidence shows ICE officials had proof of his citizenship before and after they spoke to him.\n\nICE declined to comment on the case.\n\nRamos-Gomez is one of some 20,000 U.S. citizens detained by ICE over the past 10 years, according to the Cato Institute. ICE has declined to release any figures.\n\u201cThere's been a ratcheting up of deportations and arrests by ICE over the last 10 years or so and these types of mistakes are to be expected but are unacceptable,\u201d said Douglas Rivlin, director of communications for America's Voice, an immigrant rights advocacy group. \u201cWe expect very high standards from our federal officials but we are not getting the level of accuracy and competence that we need to get from our federal officials.\u201d\n\nThe number is higher for lawful permanent residents, according to the Cato Institute. Data released by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a non-partisan organization that releases information about federal enforcement, show that, between 2008 and 2012, ICE issued detainer requests against 28,000 legal permanent residents.\n\nSince ICE has not released documents or information on any of the detainer requests, the reasons behind issuing them are unknown.\n\n\u201cAn LPR can be lawfully detained for removal purposes if they have a criminal conviction that makes them subject to deportation,\u201d said Jennie Paquerella, director of immigrants' rights and senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Southern California. \u201cThe problem is that ICE often puts detainers on LPRs who do not have such convictions and sometimes no convictions at all.\u201d\n\nPasquerella recently won a lawsuit that ruled that ICE's primary deportation program unconstitutional. The lawsuit, called Gonzalez v. ICE, is based on Gerardo Gonzalez, a natural born U.S. citizen who was issued a detainer request by ICE in 2012.\n\nAccording to the complaint, ICE has subjected more than 2 million people to these unconstitutional arrests since the inception of the program in 2008.\n\n\u201cICE is doing everything that they possibly can to prevent people who are in their custody from accessing attorneys, even from having their families know where they're being held,\u201d Rivlin said. \u201cIt's a very secretive process.\u201d\nICE declined to comment on the process federal officials have to follow when someone is detained. According to its website, facilities follow ICE\u2019s National Detention Standards, which state that only \u201cnon-U.S. citizens who are apprehended and determined to need custodial supervision are placed in detention facilities.\u201d\n\nAccording to the ACLU lawsuit, when he was arrested, Ramos-Gomez not only had his U.S. passport and REAL ID driver's license, but also his Marine Corps identification tags. At the jail in Grand Rapids, the lawsuit says, an off-duty officer with the Grand Rapids Police Department emailed an ICE agent to check on his immigration status after seeing news of his arrest on TV.\n\nThe officer claimed he suspected terrorism but emails and exchanges between the GRPD officers and ICE officials published by the ACLU reveal, the group says, that the officer never indicated the issue was urgent or that it involved terrorism. In his email, the lawsuit says, he said only that he was concerned with Ramos\u2019 immigration status.\n\nThe email resulted in ICE agents speaking to Ramos-Gomez in the Kent County jail, the ACLU says. And even though the agents reviewed his Real ID driver\u2019s license and a database that listed Ramos\u2019 birthplace as Michigan, the lawsuit says, he was nevertheless then sent to another immigration detention center in Michigan on Dec. 14, because ICE officials still believed he was undocumented.\n\n\u201cHe's booked in and he has his REAL ID compliant license that shows he is a veteran and here lawfully,\u201d said Aukerman, his attorney. \u201cAnd while he's there, he does not get the care that he needs and so his mental health seriously deteriorates.\u201d\n\nWhen ICE started removal proceedings, the notice charges incorrectly stated that Ramos-Gomez was a Guatemalan citizen who arrived unlawfully in the U.S. While he was born in Michigan, his family is from Guatemala, but in their statement, officials did not provide an explanation for why they indicated he was not a U.S. citizen and, instead, from the Central American country. Before ICE could continue, Ramos-Gomez\u2019s family attorney intervened.\n\nAn ICE agent then again reviewed and confirmed Ramos\u2019 citizenship and he was released on Dec. 17, 2018, almost a month after his arrest.\n\nSince his release, Ramos-Gomez says he is still suffering from the trauma of being detained and almost deported.\n\n\u201cIf you had a judge who would have looked at this, who would have looked at the police reports and the information that was available, no judge would have signed off on a warrant,\u201d Aukerman said.\n\nNearly a year after his arrest, the city of Grand Rapids settled a lawsuit brought by Ramos-Gomez, the city commission agreeing to pay him $190,000 for the department's involvement in his detention.\n\nFollowing the settlement with the city, the ACLU along with attorneys at the Loevy and Loevy law firm filed a lawsuit and a complaint against ICE and the Department of Homeland Security alleging wrongful detainment of the Marine Corps veteran. The ACLU is seeking unspecified compensation for Ramos-Gomez and records pertaining to his detainment and data on other U.S. citizens and lawful residents who have been detained in the hopes this situation from happening to others.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be accountability and transparency,\u201d Aukerman said. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual for ICE to actually acknowledge responsibility but with the lawsuit, they have a chance to decide whether they want to take responsibility for what they did or whether they want to fight it.\u201d\n"}
