But we have a big trade relationship, and I\u2019m sure that within a short period of time, things will be looking very rosy, we hope, that\u2019s usually the case with the two of us, we work it out.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s diplomatic tone on the issue comes after the U.S. Monday night threatened $2.4 billion in tariffs on French goods in retaliation of France\u2019s taxes that hit U.S. tech companies.\n\nTrump did not repeat his previous comment calling Macron\u2019s critique of NATO \u201cvery,very nasty\u201d and an \"insulting statement\" but President Macron, for his part, said he stands by his critique of NATO as experiencing \u201cbrain death.\u201d\nTrump earlier repeated his complaints that some NATO nations weren't paying their \"fair share.\"\n\n\u201cMy statement created some reactions,\u201d Macron said. \u201cI do stand by \u2026 When you look at what NATO is and should be, first of all, this is a burden-share, and President Trump just reminded you of some figures, that the U.S. over invested decade after decade, it was number one by far.\u201d\n\nThe president then thanked Macron for his comments in recognition of U.S. payments.\n\n\u201cI appreciate you saying the United States for decades had been paying way, way disproportionately too much for NATO and you have other countries paying far too little that are directly benefited by it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn an exchange that showed there was perhaps more tension under the surface regarding the fight against ISIS, Trump offered to send some of the \u201ctremendous amount of captured fighters\u201d to France, claiming \u201cthey're mostly from Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like some nice ISIS fighters? I can give them to you,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBut the French President wasn\u2019t having it.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be serious,\u201d Macron replied, going on to offer a response in which he talked about the need to finish the fight against ISIS.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why he\u2019s a great politician, that was one of the best non-answers I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Trump then replied.\n\nEarlier, Trump was tougher on Macron when he spoke to reporters during an appearance with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the U.S. ambassador's residence in London, ahead of a summit commemorating the 70th anniversary of the transatlantic alliance.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just go around making statements like that about NATO, it\u2019s very disrespectful,\u201d Trump said, despite his having once called NATO \u201cobsolete.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody needs [NATO] more than France,\u201d Trump said, \u201cif you just look back over the last long period of time,\u201d in an apparent reference to World War I and World War II.\n\u201cI\u2019m not in love with those companies,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anybody is going to take advantage of our companies it\u2019s going to be us,\u201d he said.\n\nFrance has threatened a forceful response if the Trump administration follows through on a proposal to hit the country's cheese, Champagne, handbags and other products with tariffs of up to 100%.\n\nLast month, in an interview with The Economist magazine, Macron had urged NATO to \u201cwake up,\u201d warning that member states were failing to cooperate on key issues and calling into question the future of the alliance.\nPresident Trump has repeatedly chastised NATO allies for not contributing enough financially to the alliance.\n\nAll 29 NATO member states have committed to increase their defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2024, but NATO data estimates that only seven members -- including the U.S. -- are estimated to meet the spending target this year.\n\nDuring the freewheeling appearance with Stoltentberg, Trump also touched on a number of other topics, including the ongoing impeachment inquiry in Washington.\n\nResponding to the suggestion that the probe may overshadow his visit, he said: \u201cDoes it cast a cloud? If it does, then the Democrats have done a great disservice to the country.\u201d\nThe president took a diplomatic approach when questioned about the general election in the summit\u2019s host country, Britain, due to take place Dec. 12. \u201cI stay out of it,\u201d he said, adding that he could \u201cwork with anybody,\u201d who came to power after the vote.\n\nTrump has in the past been a vocal support of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, once dubbing him \u201cBritain's Trump,\u201d and has criticized opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying he would be \u201cso bad\u201d for the country.\n\nABC News' Mark Hanrahan contributed to this report.
