Other first ladies who have participated in the tradition are: Jacqueline Kennedy, Eleanor Roosevelt and more recently, Michelle Obama.\n\nDuring her visit, Trump stopped in a play room to visit with the young patients and participate in an art project centered on the upcoming Christmas holiday.\nShe spent extra time crafting with three children in particular: 8-year-old Brooke Hilton, 7-year-old Nathalia Vasseur Hoffman and 8-year-old Dwayne Salmon, to whom she offered words of advice and encouragement.\n\n\"Hi sweetheart, how are you feeling?\u201d Trump asked Hilton. She continued to make small talk, asking the children when she walked in if they were \u201dFeeling strong?\u201d\n\nThe first lady then went on to ask if they had written to Santa yet.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so busy right now,\u201d Trump said of Santa Claus. \u201cYou should write him this weekend.\u201d\nThe children spent time reading quotes to her from Dr. Suess\u2019 \"Oh, the places you\u2019ll go!\"\n\nAfter spending some time making paper snowflakes, the first lady and the children made their way to the main stage to join the crowd and commence the book reading.\n\nThis year, Trump read \"Oliver the Ornament Meets Belle,\" the sequel to \"Oliver the Ornament,\" which she read last year.\n\"Oliver the Ornament\" is a seven-book series that celebrates the tradition and stories of Christmas ornaments. The story focuses on a little ornament who faces challenges, but is able to overcome all odds to save the day.\n\nJoining Trump on stage were none other than Mr. and Mrs. Claus, as well as the book\u2019s author, Todd Zimmerman.\n\nSince launching \"Oliver the Ornament,\" Zimmerman has donated over 3,000 copies of the book to hospitalized children and will be donating a percentage of profits from all books sold to various children\u2019s charities.\n\nTrump also toured the Surgical Care Unit and the Short Stay Unit to visit with patients, their families and the nursing staff.\n"}
