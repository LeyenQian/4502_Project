No one mentions @realDonaldTrump by name, but they seem to be discussing his lengthy impromptu press conferences from earlier in the day.

Later in the day, the president held a separate bilateral meeting with Trudeau, during which the president engaged with the press seated next to the Canadian prime minister for a half-hour.\n\nAsked by ABC News if Trudeau was referring to Trump and to what the prime minister was discussing, Trudeau's office declined to comment.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, when a reporter asked Trump about the video, Trump called Trudeau \"two-faced.\"\n\nBut then he added: \"And honestly with Trudeau, he's a nice guy, I find him to be a very nice guy.\"\n\nTrump said that he had \"called him out on the fact that\" Canada is spending less than 2% of its GDP on defense, to which NATO leaders had agreed and which Trump has made a signature issue.\n\n\"The truth is, I called him out on the fact that he's not paying 2%, and I guess he's not very happy about it,\" Trump said, adding: \"So I called him out on that, and I'm sure he wasn't happy about it, but that's the way it is.\"\n\nBut as he sat next to Trudeau in front of reporters on Tuesday, Trump was asked if he was \"happy with Canadian defense spending as it is right now,\" and said he was \"satisfied\" with Canada's increased levels of spending.\n\n\"Well, they\u2019re moving up, and they\u2019re moving up substantially,\" Trump said. \"And they\u2019re starting to do very well, economically. And that has something to do with it. And, yeah, they\u2019re getting up to a level that's getting to be very acceptable. They have been under the 2%, obviously, but they\u2019re moving up. We discuss it. I\u2019m satisfied with it.\"\n\nTrudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's most recent statements about the Canadian prime minister on Wednesday."}
