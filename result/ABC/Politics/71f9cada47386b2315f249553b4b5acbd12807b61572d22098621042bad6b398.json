Here are five takeaways from the 2 1/2 hour discussion.\n\n1. Clinton believes there was a quid pro quo from President Donald Trump.\n\nClinton said she believes that Trump was trying to bribe Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in their July phone call.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not mince words -- Trump was trying to bribe the president of Ukraine to take action by announcing the beginning of an investigation on an unfounded theory against his domestic political opponent for his personal and political gain,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it up. Who would ever think anybody would do that?\u201d\n2. Clinton said attending Trump\u2019s inauguration was one of the hardest days of her life.\n\n\u201cI went to the inauguration of Donald Trump, which was one of the hardest days of my life, to be honest,\u201d she said. She remarked on how she was seated next to former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, during Trump\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cThen he started on that speech, which was so bizarre, and that\u2019s when I got really worried,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd George W. Bush says to me, 'Well that was some weird s---.'\u201d\n\n3. Clinton warned of the dangers of interference in the 2020 election, and said that she has told Democratic candidates to be wary of what could happen. \n\n\u201cI think that, you know, look, the Russians and WikiLeaks really did a job on me, both in terms of the way they weaponized information and then the way that they -- they\u2019re doing it again, they\u2019re doing it to whoever else is going to be up there,\u201d she said.\n4. Clinton stopped short of saying who she supports in the race so far, telling Stern she will support whoever the nominee is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the voters to decide,\u201d she said. But Clinton did say she thinks that, based on polling, the nominee will be former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s too soon to tell because nobody has voted or caucused, so right now, according to the polls, Biden is going to get the nomination. But that\u2019s, you know, a long way off,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also said that in the indictments of Russian troll groups from the 2016 elections, \u201cthey\u2019re basically like, \u2018Hey let\u2019s do everything we can to elect Donald Trump,\u2019 ... I mean it also said Bernie Sanders, but that\u2019s for another day.\u201d\n\n5. Clinton said Sen. Bernie Sanders \"hurt\" her in the general election, but, after being prompted by Stern, said that she does not hate him.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate anybody,\u201d she said, though she did argue that Sanders could have endorsed her quicker after he left the race.\n\u201cHe could have. He hurt me, there\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I hope he doesn\u2019t do it again to whoever gets the nomination. Once is enough.\u201d\n\nSanders endorsed Clinton in early July of 2016, about a month after it became known that Clinton had the delegates nationwide to obtain the nomination, and a week before the Democratic National Convention.\n\nClinton has largely ruled out a run in 2020, but has remained in the public eye as she promotes her new book, \"The Book of Gutsy Women,\" which she co-authored with her daughter. She did say, though, that she plans to work to help elect a Democrat in 2020.\n"}
