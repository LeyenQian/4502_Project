The hands-off investigation policy was extended to the rest of the Democratic field but not to the president\u2019s reelection campaign.\nTrump campaign officials, who have been weighing how to respond for the past week, called it a bias decision.\n\n\"Since they have declared their bias openly, the Trump campaign will no longer credential representatives of Bloomberg News for rallies or other campaign events. We will determine whether to engage with individual reporters or answer inquiries from Bloomberg News on a case-by-case basis,\" Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s reelection campaign manager, wrote in a statement.\nParscale noted the policy is set in stone until Bloomberg News publicly rescinds its decision.\n\nThe Republican National Committee, which has worked in lockstep with the Trump campaign on its reelection efforts, quickly backed the decision and committed to no longer giving credentials to Bloomberg News reporters at its events.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s senior adviser, Howard Wolfson, responded to the news on Twitter, writing, \"one week in and Mike is already under Trump' skin.\"One week in and Mike is already under Trump' skin. https://t.co/jyIBVXUToj\nIn a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Micklethwait stood by his decision.\n\n\"The accusation of bias couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\" Micklethwait said in a statement. \"We have covered Donald Trump fairly and in an unbiased way since he became a candidate in 2015 and will continue to do so despite the restrictions imposed by the Trump campaign.\"\n"}
