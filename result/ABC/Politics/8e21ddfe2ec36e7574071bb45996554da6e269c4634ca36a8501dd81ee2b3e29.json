He feels very strongly,\u201d the president. \u201cI think they're going to help out the families very greatly.\u201d\nIn addition to speaking with the king, the president also spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman on Sunday. The White House said in a statement that the president expressed appreciation for Saudi Arabia\u2019s alliance and their assistance in the investigation during the call.\n\n\u201cThe Crown Prince reiterated Saudi Arabia\u2019s commitment to working with the United States to prevent a horrific attack like the Pensacola shooting from ever happening again.  The President thanked the Crown Prince for Saudi Arabia\u2019s assistance with the investigation and continued partnership,\" the statement said.\n\nThe president's defense of Saudi Arabia comes as the FBI has said they are investigating the incident on the presumption that it was terror.\n\n\u201cWe are, as we do in most active-shooter investigations, working with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism,\u201d Rachel Rojas, special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Jacksonville division, said.\nThe shooter, Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, was a student naval flight officer in the U.S. as part of a program under which the U.S. military provides training forces of allied countries that purchase American-made military aircraft. There are currently more than 850 Saudi nationals in the US for military training and 5,181 total foreign military students.\n\nThe shooter had been in the U.S. since 2017 as part of the training program and was scheduled to complete his training in August 2020.\n\nWhile the president has maintained only a friendly tone toward Saudi Arabia, one of the president's staunchest congressional allies, Rep Matt Gaetz, has called on the U.S. to hit the pause button on accepting more Saudi students until the U.S. can establish confidence in its vetting program.  He also suggested the incident could change the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cOf course, what happened is Pensacola has to inform on our ongoing relationship with Saudi Arabia. That is the message I directly delivered to the Saudi Ambassador when she called to offer her condolences,\u201d Gaetz said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n"}
