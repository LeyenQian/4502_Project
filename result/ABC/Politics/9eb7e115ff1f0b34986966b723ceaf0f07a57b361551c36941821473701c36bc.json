Just don\u2019t call him old.\n\nA confluence of forces have vaulted former Vice President Joe Biden back to a solid position as the national front-runner in a range of polls released Wednesday, along with strong standing in the Super Tuesday giants of California and Texas.\nPresident Donald Trump has made him the main focus of his attacks even as impeachment draws closer. Biden is also the potential beneficiary of recent scrutiny on Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- as well as Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 exit from the race, since that eliminated a potential major rival in South Carolina.\n\nAnd Biden\u2019s standing wasn\u2019t shaken by the late entries of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Gov. Deval Patrick. Both candidacies were viewed as statements on Biden\u2019s viability, or lack thereof.\n\nOne-term pledge or not -- and the answer is a definitive no, at least for now -- the concept that it would stabilize the country is a potentially powerful one for Biden.\n\nHis campaign wants to project steadiness. His poll numbers are nothing if not steady.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with Kendall Karson\n\nMichael Bloomberg's attempts to define himself as a pragmatic alternative to the rest of the Democratic field are often thwarted by the heightened scrutiny that comes with becoming a presidential candidate, as he first has to dance around questions about his past, particularly his longstanding support for \"stop-and-frisk\" policing.\n\n\"We tried a lot of things; my whole focus was on reducing the murder rate, in looking back and certainly in the third term, I think it got out of hand,\" he conceded on Wednesday during a stop in California, one of the 16 Super Tuesday states and territories he is betting his presidency on. \"Maybe I should have paid more attention, but it got out of hand when we realized that it was too much. ... And then I said, 'Look I made a mistake,' and apologized for it.\"\nAs Bloomberg referenced his rare apology -- which came a week before he announced a bid for the nation's highest office and was a stunning reversal for the former mayor who vigorously defended the policy throughout his tenure -- he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Stockton, California, Mayor Michael Tubbs, a young African American and rising Democratic star, who stepped in to defend the presidential contender as he was peppered with questions from reporters about \"stop and frisk.\u201d\n\n\"I think a leader is one who apologizes,\" Tubbs said, after Bloomberg scored his endorsement.\n\nBut even when he drops $10 million for vulnerable House Democrats to help them compete against a slew of GOP-backed anti-impeachment ads, shifting the focus off himself, Bloomberg is still being dogged by the ghosts of his mayoral past. It appears his unconventional pursuit of the party\u2019s presidential nomination is left more reliant on his massive $100 million TV ad buy -- where he gets up to 60 seconds of unfettered time to frame his candidacy.\n\nThe TIP with Chris Donato and Averi Harper\n\nTwo members of the so-called \"squad,\u201d Reps. Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley will be hitting the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Friday trying to sway young voters for two candidates over 70.\n\nThe progressive congresswomen of color are lending their political capital to support progressive 2020 hopefuls.\n\nOmar has endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders while Pressley has endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and is a co-chair for Warren\u2019s campaign.\nOmar will attend a town hall with Sanders in Manchester and cohost a rally in Nashua.\n\nThey\u2019ll both bring their sway to young Democrats on Friday. Pressley will speak on behalf of Warren at the New Hampshire Young Democrats Granite Slate Awards. Omar will join Sanders when he, too, speaks at the awards in Manchester.\n\nIt\u2019s the first trip to the Granite State for both members of the squad, a group that includes Sanders-endorser Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as well. Pressley\u2019s visit comes as Warren has seen a dip in the polls; in a Quinnipiac poll released earlier this week, Warren received 15% from voters, down from 28% on October.\n\nONE MORE THING\n\nGearing up for an impeachment trial in the Senate, President Donald Trump and his top advisers are considering expanding his legal team and bringing on controversial attorney and professor Alan Dershowitz, multiple sources told ABC News. Dershowitz attended an event Wednesday at the White House and was asked to speak briefly by the president ahead of signing an executive order on anti-Semitism.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" podcast.
