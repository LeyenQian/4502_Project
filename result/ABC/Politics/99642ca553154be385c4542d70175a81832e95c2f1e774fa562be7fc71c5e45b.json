Timothy Kinsella said during a press conference in the aftermath of the shooting\n\n\"The cross-training with allies is something that we have done for a long time,\" he said. \"In World War II, we had Royal Air Force folks training here.\"\nSaudi Arabia, according to the Pentagon, is one such ally, and has supplied 852 of the more than 5,000 foreign military students spread throughout the U.S.\n\nGermany, Singapore, Italy, Denmark and Norway have also sent students to Naval Air Station Pensacola, also known as the \"Cradle of Naval Aviation.\"\n\nNAS Pensacola employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel, according to the base's website. The facility includes the Naval Aviation Schools Command, Naval Air Technical Training Center, Marine Aviation Training Support Group 21 and 23, the Blue Angels and the headquarters for Naval Education Training Command.\n\nAccording to Kinsella, only authorized security forces are allowed to carry weapons on the base. It's still unclear how Alshamrani was able to bring a handgun into the classroom and begin shooting.\n\nAnd while Alshamrani's motive remains unclear, law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told ABC News authorities are focusing on two possibilities: that he was acting for ideological reasons, or that some kind of hostilities developed over the course of his training.\nShortly after the shooting, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saudi Arabia was \"going to owe a debt here,\" and numerous Saudi officials condemned the attack in statements.\n\n\"Today's tragic shooting at Pensacola, Florida was a heinous crime. The Kingdom expresses its deepest condolences to the families of victims, and to the American people. We salute the bravery of those who neutralized the threat and saved lives,\" Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan tweeted.Today's tragic shooting at Pensacola, Florida was a heinous crime.
