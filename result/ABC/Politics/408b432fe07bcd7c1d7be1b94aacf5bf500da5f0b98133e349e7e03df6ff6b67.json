Whereas Republicans argue in the new report that the transcript of Trump\u2019s call doesn\u2019t show \u201cconditionality, pressure or coercion,\u201d witnesses testified that such pressure was implied because Ukraine was a vulnerable democracy still fighting Russia at its border and desperate for U.S. support.\n\nWitnesses also called into question the president\u2019s insistence that he was genuinely focused on corruption and not domestic politics. Ambassador Gordon Sondland, a Trump megadonor, testified that the White House only wanted Ukraine to announce an investigation that included Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement in the Ukraine gas company, Burima, and that he didn\u2019t think it was necessary for Ukraine to conduct the probe.\nFormer National Security Council aide Fiona Hill called this push a \u201cdomestic political errand.\u201d And she directly disputed Trump\u2019s theory that Ukraine \u2013 not Russia \u2013 meddled in the 2016 election, calling it a \u201cfictional narrative\u201d pushed by Russian security services.\nIn the Republican report, they insist there is \u201ccompelling and indisputable evidence that Ukrainian officials\u201d sought to influence the election in favor of Democrat Hilary Clinton. While some Ukrainian politicians did support Hillary Clinton over Trump, U.S. intelligence and a bipartisan Senate inquiry found the primary culprit behind election interference was Russia, which engaged in a widespread, invasive and secretive campaign to sway voters in support of Trump.\n\nRepublicans also argued there was no evidence of \"bribery\" or \"extortion.\"\n\n\u201cThe evidence presented does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats\u2019 witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor,\" the report states.\n\nThe Republicans add that Trump is accountable to voters and that Americans will decide whether he acted in their best interests come 2020.\n\n\"The accountability to the American people comes at the ballot box, not in House Democrats\u2019 star chamber,\" they stated.\n"}
