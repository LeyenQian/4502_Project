It was unclear what the content depicts and the committees only began accessing the material last week.\n\nSources told ABC News the tapes were provided as part of that congressional subpoena issued to Parnas, and the former Giuliani ally also provided a number of documents both in English and Ukrainian to the committee in two separate productions, sources told ABC News.\n\nSources familiar with the matter told ABC News last month that some of the material sought by congressional investigators is already in possession of federal investigators within the Southern District of New York and thus held up from being turned over. It is unclear if this material is what Bondy was asking the court to release to Congress Monday.\"\n\nSo far, Parnas is the only defendant in the New York case to cooperate with the House Intelligence committee\u2019s investigation.\nParnas was carrying 6 phones, tablets and computers when he was arrested, Zolkind said, adding that another 8 devices were seized at his home.\n\nZolkind suggested Parnas could speed up the extraction of material from his phones if he would provide the passwords, rather than relying on the FBI\u2019s forensic experts.\n\nBondy also said there are paper records in the government\u2019s possession that his client would like to turn over.\n\nA protective order governing the case requires Parnas to get court approval before turning over to Congress any materials seized as part of the criminal investigation.\n\n\"I expect to grant that request,\" Judge Paul Oetken said"}
