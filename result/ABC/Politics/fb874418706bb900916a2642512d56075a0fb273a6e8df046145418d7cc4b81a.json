The administration pledged to enact a new policy to take flavored vaping products off the market earlier this year by enforcing current FDA rules but the plan seems to have stalled.\nHe was confirmed by a vote of 72-18.\n\nPresident Donald Trump nominated Hahn in November to replace former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who abruptly left the agency in March.\nHahn has spent the majority of his career as a radiation oncologist researching lung cancer and sarcoma. He was named chief medical executive of MD Anderson in 2018.\n\nPrior to that he worked as chair of the radiation oncology department at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nABC News' Trish Turner contributed to this report.\n"}
