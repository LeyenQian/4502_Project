Matt Gaetz of Florida, who led a Republican protest in the closed-door SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) and disrupted the Intelligence Committee\u2019s work in October, and Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, who has accused Democrats of waging a \u201ccoup\u201d against the president, are both members of the committee, and will take part in questioning of any witnesses moving forward.\nFor the majority, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a constitutional law professor-turned-Trump critic who has helped craft the party\u2019s messaging on impeachment, and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the chair of the Democratic caucus and potential successor to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are among the Democrats to watch.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee also includes veterans of past impeachment efforts, including GOP Reps. Steve Chabot of Ohio and Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who were House mangers in the Senate trial in President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who was a committee staffer during Watergate.\nFour members of the committee will be familiar faces to viewers of the Intelligence Committee\u2019s hearings: Democratic Reps. Eric Swalwell of California and Val Demmings of Florida, along with Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and John Ratcliffe of Texas who serve on both panels.\n\nDemocrats plan keep the hearing focused on the details of the Ukraine impeachment investigation, and whether they meet the constitutional threshold of bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors.\nNadler under pressure to wield a sharp gavel like Schiff and keep Republicans at bay\n\nAfter Schiff led two weeks of tightly-controlled hearings, many hope Nadler will be able to keep the hearing on track, and prevent the session from resembling the combative hearing with Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, earlier this year, before the Ukraine matter exploded into public view.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, have accused Democrats of running an investigation that has denied Trump due process and the ability to question fact witnesses to events at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Using parliamentary inquiries and points of order, they could seek to fluster Democrats and air their concerns about the proceedings.\n\nThe White House has rejected Democrats\u2019 offer to participate in Wednesday\u2019s hearing, but has not ruled out taking part in subsequent hearings.\n\u201cWe're back, by the way, in rerun season here in the Judiciary Committee. We've already had constitutional scholars in the committee talking about from the Mueller report and others,\u201d Rep. Doug Collins, R-Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d this past weekend, referring to the committee\u2019s earlier hearings on the investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\u201cThis is a complete American waste of time,\u201d Collins said, foreshadowing the kind of attacks he and other republicans can be expected to stage when the hearing gets underway.\n\nSchiff, meanwhile, says his committee will not let up.\n\n\u201cEven while Judiciary does its work, we will continue investigating.\u201d he said on MSNBC Monday night.\n\nHe did not tip his hand on the timing of any impeachment vote, but said Democrats believe the matter has some \u201curgency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a threat to the integrity of the upcoming election, and we don\u2019t feel that it should wait.\u201d\n\nHe also said he believes the evidence of obstruction of Congress is \u201coverwhelming.\u201d\n\nWhat are the witnesses expected to say?\n\nThe Judiciary Committee will hear from three constitutional experts called by Democrats and one by Republicans.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s witness, George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley, recently wrote in The Hill:\n\n\u201cHouse Democrats have done a masterful job of holding hearings with testimony from distinguished diplomatic and national security witnesses on the alleged quid pro quo that President Trump sought from Ukraine. The problem is that the record is incomplete and conflicted on critical points. The question is whether Democrats want a real or a recreational impeachment. A real impeachment case can be made, but to make it, they will have to reschedule, reframe, and repeat their House investigation. As compelling and upsetting as much of the testimony has been, the record still lacks direct evidence of a quid pro quo on American military aid to Ukraine,\" Turley wrote.\n\nTestifying for the Democrats, Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School, recently wrote in The New York Times: \u201cTo be sure, Donald Trump had already created a crisis in the presidency by abusing the power of his office to pressure foreign governments to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But that act on its own didn\u2019t count as a constitutional crisis, because the Constitution prescribes an answer to presidential abuse of office: impeachment.\n\n\u201cNow that President Trump has announced \u2014 via a letter signed by Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel \u2014 that he will not cooperate in any way with the impeachment inquiry begun in the House of Representatives, we no longer have just a crisis of the presidency. We also have a breakdown in the fundamental structure of government under the Constitution. That counts as a constitutional crisis,\u201d Feldman said,\n\nAnother Democratic witness, Michael Gerhardt a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, wrote in The Atlantic:\n\n\u201cIf you add up the nonsense that the president\u2019s defenders have proliferated and his protestation that the Constitution allows him to do whatever he wants, their proposed result is disturbing: an executive who can shut down an impeachment inquiry and protect from disclosure anything done by anyone in the executive branch, and who is immune to criminal investigation and allowed to defy subpoenas.\n\n\u201cThis is not the president our Constitution established. He would be a king, in spite of the fact that the Founders\u2019 generation rebelled against one. They set out to create a presidency that was accountable to Congress if the occupant abused power and breached the public\u2019s trust. Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to delegitimize the impeachment inquiry destroy their vision,\u201d Gerhardt wrote.\n\nThe third Democratic witness is Pamela Khan, a professor at Stanford Law School.\n"}
