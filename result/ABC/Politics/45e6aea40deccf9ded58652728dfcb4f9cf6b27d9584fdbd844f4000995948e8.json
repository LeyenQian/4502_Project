Now, Rep. Duncan Hunter said he will change his plea to guilty on Tuesday in a federal campaign-finance case.\n\nHunter was the second House member to endorse candidate Donald Trump in 2016. He will now join the first to do so, former Rep. Chris Collins, in pleading guilty to a felony charge after initially claiming he was being prosecuted out of political malice.\n\nIt's the latest example of the limits of a defense of denial and deflection in the face of actual evidence. Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and others in and around the Trump orbit got similar lessons.\nNow, with impeachment moving forward with an initial House Intelligence Committee vote on Tuesday, the bigger question is whether similar limits apply to someone who also has the powers of the presidency.\n\nRepublican House members from the Intelligence Committee are out with a pre-buttal, arguing that Democrats are relying on \"hearsay, presumption and emotion\" as a \"tool for settling political scores.\" They're choosing not to contest the basic facts.\n\nImpeachment, of course, is more a political process than it is a legal one. That distinction has kept the Democrats' push on a steady track -- and is helping keep Republicans in line.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nPresident Donald Trump's trip abroad to London this week to meet with NATO leaders serves as poignant reminder to American voters that there is a long list of urgent policy matters facing the international community, including terrorism, refugee crises and the threat of Russian aggression beyond its borders.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators on Monday called for new sanctions against one key ally in the alliance.\n\nSens. Lindsey Graham and Chris Van Hollen wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking him to consider sanctions on Turkey, following reports that the country is testing components of a Russian air missile system \u2013 the latest evidence that Russia's efforts to cozy up to the NATO partner are working.\n\nCoordinated, collective defense and strategic communication between the allies in NATO is one of the perks of membership.\nBut Pentagon officials have said the Russian air system Turkey is testing poses a threat to NATO systems, because Russia could use its system to pinpoint the American F-35s capabilities and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi is countering the president's foreign trip with one of her own.\n\nTo both represent the U.S. and serve as a foil to the current White House, she is leading a large congressional delegation to the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, as the Trump administration continues to distance itself from most global efforts on the topic.\n\nThe TIP with Cheyenne Haslett\n\nJust over 60 days away from the Iowa caucuses, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has found herself slipping in the polls and running in a race that continues to shift around her.\n\nAnd though Warren maintains that she doesn't \"do\" polls, nor does she plan to change in response to them, her recent swing through Iowa showed a glimpse of deviation in a campaign that's been set in its ways for nearly 11 months.\nShortening her stump speech and taking a dozen questions from the crowd, the different style -- however slight -- offered an air of unpredictability and, at times, tearful, candid moments. So is the candidate switching things up to regain enthusiasm?\n\n\"No,\" Warren told ABC News on Monday night. \"This is a chance to just talk to more people and hear their questions and field more questions. I've been fielding questions since the very first event I did right at the beginning, in Iowa.\"\n\nExpect the more voter-centered style to continue on the trail, especially in small towns or cities across Iowa where Warren has spoken multiple times before -- and where personal connections are the way to victory.\n\nONE MORE THING\n\nA new report by House Republicans, reviewed by ABC News on Monday, argues that President Donald Trump shouldn't be impeached because there is no evidence that his actions were done specifically to \"benefit in the 2020 election.\" The 123-page report is the official GOP response after several weeks of closed-door and public testimony that detailed Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to announce an investigation that included Democrat Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" podcast.
