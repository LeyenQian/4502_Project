Why should they care?\" Schiff said, \"This is not about Ukraine. This is about our democracy. This is about our national security,\" adding, \"Americans should care deeply about whether the president of the United States is betraying their trust in him.\"\n\n\"We should care about this. We must care about this,\" Schiff said, arguing that if not, Trump would be \"back at it again.\"\nThe report, which can be read here, directly accuses the president of a \u201cscheme\u201d that leveraged his power in office for his own personal and political gain. Democrats allege there is enough evidence from witness testimony and documents to find that Trump conditioned a White House meeting, as well as nearly $400 million in military aid, on Ukraine\u2019s willingness to launch an investigation that included Trump\u2019s 2020 political rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe 300-page report also accuses the president of obstructing the impeachment inquiry by telling witnesses to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony. Several of those witnesses defied those demands and testified anyway.\n\u201cThe President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation\u2019s upcoming presidential election to his advantage,\u201d Schiff, D-Calif., states in a preface to the report. \u201cIn doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nSchiff said the president and his supporters have attacked \u201cthe very idea of fact and truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica remains the beacon of democracy and opportunity for freedom-loving people around the world \u2026 What we do will determine what they see, and whether America remains a nation committed to the rule of law,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhile the report makes no explicit recommendation for possible articles of impeachment, it offers a detailed roadmap that the House Judiciary Committee is expected to use to write them. The report details the president\u2019s actions to leverage Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy with the help of his close advisers -- specifically naming acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, along with other administration officials.\n\nThe report accuses the president of undermining U.S. national security interests and U.S. policy as it relates to Ukraine. It is divided into two sections -- one focused on the substance of the allegations detailing the president\u2019s alleged abuse of power and the second section outlines the obstruction of the impeachment inquiry, focusing on witness intimidation and blocking witness testimony.\nThe report was released while Trump was attending a NATO summit in London, but the White House was ready with a dismissive response.\n\n\"At the end of a one-sided sham process, Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump. This report reflects nothing more than their frustrations. Chairman Schiff\u2019s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee released their own report Monday evening which refutes many of the findings laid out by the Democrats.\n\nThat 123-page GOP report argues that Trump should not be impeached because there is no evidence that his actions were done specifically to \u201cbenefit in the 2020 election.\u201d\nRepublicans will have until Thursday to reply to the report voted on Tuesday with their own remarks that will also be passed along to the House Judiciary Committee.\nOnce the Judiciary Committee has had time to consider the report and conduct their own hearings, the first of which is scheduled for Wednesday, they\u2019ll determine whether or not to propose articles of impeachment.\nA joint statement on that point from Schiff and fellow Democrats -- Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney-- read: \u201cIt will be up to the Congress to determine whether these acts rise to the level of an impeachable offense, whether the President shall be held to account, and whether we as a nation are committed to the rule of law\u2014or, instead, whether a president who uses the power of his office to coerce foreign interference in a U.S. election is something that Americans must simply \u2018get over.\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the release of our report, the American people can review for themselves the evidence detailing President Trump\u2019s betrayal of the public trust.\u201d\n\nA whistleblower report which alleged that Trump had dangled a White House meeting and military aid to Ukraine in exchange for Ukrainian officials opening an investigation into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, on a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy launched the House impeachment investigation earlier this year.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost nine weeks since members of the House Intelligence Committee began hearing from witnesses as part of the impeachment investigation.\nThe committee publicly interviewed 12 officials over the two weeks leading up to the Thanksgiving recess. Those hearings followed almost six weeks of closed door depositions with 17 individuals.\n\nDuring both public and closed door hearings, officials interviewed consistently testified that they believed a meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy was contingent upon Zelenskiy making an announcement of plans to investigate Biden.\n\nThis is a claim that Trump and other White House officials have denied.\n"}
