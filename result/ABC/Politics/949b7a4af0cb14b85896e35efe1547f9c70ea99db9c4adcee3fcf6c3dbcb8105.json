It has been the honor and privilege of a lifetime to serve in the @realDonaldTrump Administration as your Secretary. Thank you to my wife, my children, and to the American people for allowing me to serve. Signing off. \u2013 RP pic.twitter.com/AlxYNLsqrf\n\u2014 Rick Perry (@SecretaryPerry) December 2, 2019\n\nBrouillette is the 15th U.S. Secretary of Energy. An official swearing in ceremony will take place at a later date, the Department of Energy said in a statement.\n\nTrump formally nominated Brouillette on Nov. 7 as Perry prepared to step down, amid scrutiny over the role he played in the president's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nPrior to Monday's confirmation, Brouillette had served as deputy energy secretary since August 2017, when he was confirmed in a bipartisan 79-17 vote. In that role, he led day-to-day operations at the Department of Energy under Perry.\nLast month, during Brouillette's nomination hearing before the Senate committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., pressed Brouillette on his knowledge of conversations between Perry, Naftogaz -- a Ukrainian oil and gas company -- and President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\n\"Are you aware of the nature of any communications with Naftogaz?\" Wyden asked. \"Because initially you said you knew there were communications, so being the deputy, I'd be inclined to say somebody like yourself -- who's knowledgeable, I've watched you over the years -- would know a little bit about the nature of the conversations.\"\n\nBrouillette repeatedly said during the hearing that he wasn't aware of or a part of the conversations.\n\n\"I wasn't party to that, I didn't have any knowledge of that,\" he said in response to Wyden. \"I am aware that within the department there are technical experts that from time-to-time will interact with colleagues about these types of matters. But I'm not aware of any conversations between the secretary and anyone at Naftogaz.\"\n\nBrouillette also praised nuclear energy and new carbon capture technologies at the Nov. 15 hearing, while claiming that non-renewable energy sources are still a necessity for the U.S.\n\n\"We are on the cutting edge of a number of exciting technologies like advanced nuclear energy, carbon capture, and energy storage,\u201d Brouillette said. \u201cIf we care about the carbon impact, we need to get these technologies off of the shelf and into the market.\"\n\nTrump announced his plans to nominate Brouillette on Twitter back in October, one day after Perry -- who has been described by colleagues as one of the \"three amigos\" on U.S. policy on Ukraine -- announced his impending resignation from the Energy Department's top job.....He is also my friend! At the same time, I am pleased to nominate Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette to be the new Secretary of Energy. Dan's experience in the sector is unparalleled. A total professional, I have no doubt that Dan will do a great job!\nBroulliette responded with a video on Twitter, tagging the president.\n\n\"I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve in your cabinet and I am ready to get to work,\" Brouillette wrote.\nThank you President @realDonaldTrump for nominating me to be your next @Energy Secretary. I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve in your cabinet and I am ready to get to work. pic.twitter.com/agyEJzXF6K\nPerry also released a statement wishing his deputy success.\n\n\"I have the utmost confidence the Department of Energy will continue to thrive under Dan Brouillette,\" Perry said in the statement. \"Dan has faithfully served as my Deputy, helping to advance American energy security and position the United States as the world's premier energy leader.\"\nPrior to becoming the deputy energy secretary, Brouillette served as chief of staff to the House Energy and Commerce Committee and was assistant secretary of energy for congressional and intergovernmental affairs in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nBefore joining the Trump administration in 2017, he most recently worked as an executive at the United Services Automobile Association and the Ford Motor Co. He also served as a member of Louisiana's State Mineral and Energy Board.\n\nBrouillette is a Louisiana native, graduate of the the University of Maryland and longtime resident of San Antonio, Texas. He and his wife, Adrienne, are U.S. Army veterans and have nine children together.\n\n ABC News' Sophie Tatum and Stephanie Ebbs contributed to this report."}
