It will work to \u201cmove more able-bodied recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) towards self-sufficiency and into employment,\u201d according to  a press release.\nStates are currently able to get a waiver from existing work requirements based on an area\u2019s unemployment rate and job availability.\n\nUnder the new rule, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will raise the standard for when states are eligible for a waiver from work requirements by adjusting the unemployment rate needed to qualify.\n\nStates have been given a limited number of waivers to extend SNAP benefits for individuals who are subject to the time limit, those waivers can be carried over and accrued by states year-to-year. Under the new regulation, USDA will now set \u201ca reasonable limit on the carryover of unused discretionary exemptions,\u201d according to the rule.\n\nThe rule faced immediate pushback from groups and members of Congress who argue it would hurt individuals in need.\nMichigan Democrat Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, called the administration \u201cout of touch with families who are struggling to make ends meet by working seasonal jobs or part time jobs with unreliable hours,\u201d in response to the announcement.\n\nStabenow said the rule will hurt individuals who work in the tourism industry and others who have \u201cunreliable hours like waiters and waitresses\u201d in particular.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, of New York, called the rule \u201cheartless\u201d and \u201ccruel,\u201d saying it is \u201cdriving the vulnerable into hunger just as the Christmas season approaches.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt exposes a deep and shameful cruelness, and hypocrisy in this administration.\u201d\nStacy Dean, vice president of food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said it \u201ctargets very poor people struggling to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaking away basic food assistance from these individuals will only increase hardship and hunger, while doing nothing to help them find steady full-time work,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nDean called the final rule \u201cmuch worse than the proposed policy,\u201d saying it \u201cmakes it much harder for states with high unemployment to qualify for waivers during a national recession.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat change really weakens SNAP\u2019s ability to assist the unemployed during an economic downturn,\u201d Dean\u2019s statement continued.\nAccording to the Agriculture Department, the unemployment rate in 2000 was at 4%, while individuals receiving benefits from SNAP was \u201cjust over\u201d 17 million. In 2019, the unemployment rate stands at 3.6%, with more than 36 million individuals receiving SNAP benefits, the USDA said in its statement.\n\n\u201cAmericans are generous people who believe it is their responsibility to help their fellow citizens when they encounter a difficult stretch,\u201d Perdue said in the statement.\n\n\u201cGovernment can be a powerful force for good, but government dependency has never been the American dream. We need to encourage people by giving them a helping hand but not allowing it to become an indefinitely giving hand,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, in the midst of the strongest economy in a generation, we need everyone who can work, to work.\u201d\n\nThe rule would impact \u201cable-bodied adults\u201d without dependents between 18-49 years old. USDA said in the statement it would not apply to \u201cchildren and their parents, those over 50 years old including the elderly, those with a disability, or pregnant women.\u201d\nThe USDA added there are \u201cmultiple ways for individuals to engage and maintain their SNAP benefits, from working, to preparing for work, and volunteering,\u201d like states providing employment training programs.\n\n\u201cStates also have access to programs and services provided by other Federal agencies, state and county governments, and local service providers,\u201d the USDA statement said.\n\n ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs also contributed to this report.
