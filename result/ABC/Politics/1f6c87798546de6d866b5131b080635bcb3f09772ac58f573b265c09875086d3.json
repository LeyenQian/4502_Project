(While some Ukrainian politicians did support Clinton over Trump in largely public ways, U.S. intelligence and a bipartisan Senate inquiry found that Russian operatives -- at the behest of their government -- engaged in a far more widespread, invasive and secretive campaign to sway voters in support of Trump.)\n\nSecond, Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate one of his 2020 political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter for his work on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nThe whistleblower described his colleagues on the call as \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by Trump\u2019s demands and detailed an internal effort internally to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the discussion.\n\nSince that bombshell allegation was made public, other witnesses have corroborated the person\u2019s account and the White House released a summary of the call that describes Trump asking Ukraine for a \u201cfavor\u201d and to investigate the Bidens.\n\u201cQuid pro quo\u201d is Latin meaning \u201csomething for something.\u201d The term is used in employment law, for example, to prohibit sexual harassment, and under federal laws against bribery.\n\nWhen it comes to foreign policy though, such negotiations are actually quite common when the U.S. demand is tied to America\u2019s national security interests. One example is asking a country to tackle corruption before receiving U.S. assistance.\n\nIn the case of Ukraine, however, the alleged quid pro quo wasn\u2019t about national security but about dangling U.S. money and a presidential summit at the White House in exchange for investigating a political rival.\n\nBy the time Trump had asked Ukraine\u2019s president for a \u201cfavor\u201d on the phone on July 25, he had already suspended nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid. Advisers to Trump wanted the aid released because it was needed by Ukraine to fend off Russian aggression. They also wanted a White House summit between the two leaders to show U.S. support for the new government.\n\nAs one Army officer assigned to the National Security Council \u2013 Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman \u2013 testified, Trump was pressuring a foreign power that desperately needed America\u2019s help in exchange for its willingness to target U.S. citizens for the president\u2019s personal gain.\n\n\u201cThere was no doubt\u201d about what Trump wanted, Vindman told Congress.\n\nTrump has denied anything was wrong with the phone call, insisting it was \u201cperfect.\u201d Some Democrats, though, compare it to extortion.\n\nThe short answer is that it doesn\u2019t matter if the act is illegal when it comes to impeachment.\n\nImpeachment is a political process enshrined in the Constitution. It essentially provides a pathway for elected lawmakers to remove presidents whose actions are considered such a gross abuse of power that elected officials don\u2019t want them to finish out their term.\nAnd while the Constitution references \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d the founding fathers didn\u2019t necessarily interpret that to mean a violation of U.S. law. As Benjamin Franklin, in a 1787 speech put it: Without impeachment, the only \u201crecourse\u201d for the American public in dealing with a leader who had \u201crendered himself obnoxious\u201d was assassination. And allowing for impeachment under the Constitution would give America a way to examine misconduct without resorting to violence.\n\nOn the question of whether Trump broke any laws, political campaigns are prohibited from taking anything of value from a foreign national. But the Justice Department declined to pursue the case because it didn\u2019t have evidence that campaign finance laws were violated; officials told reporters it would have been difficult to \u201cquantify\u201d what Trump would have gotten from Ukraine in return.\n\nAs for facing criminal prosecution, the Constitution doesn\u2019t say whether a sitting president can be charged in office, and the Justice Department has long had a policy that it shouldn\u2019t happen because it would undermine the executive branch.\n\nTrump and GOP lawmakers initially insisted there never was a quid pro quo with Ukraine and that the original whistleblower was motivated by politics. After several witnesses testified that they a presidential summit -- and possibly military aid -- was tied to Ukraine's willingness to investigate the Bidens, Republicans countered in a report released on Dec. 2 that there was no hard proof Trump was acting specifically to sway the 2020 campaign. (Trump\u2019s intention with Ukraine would require the president or his closest aides to testify, but the White House has declined to cooperate with the inquiry.)\nThey also argue that Ukraine eventually received the money it wanted. While it's correct that the administration promised to release the aid on Sept. 11, by that point the White House was already alerted to the whistleblower complaint and Democrats had already announced an inquiry into what they called Trump's \"Ukraine scheme.\"\n\nBut another key argument by Republicans could stick. They note that Democrats have been talking about impeachment since Trump took power in 2017. GOP lawmakers say the latest inquiry is just the most recent \u2013 and coordinated effort \u2013 to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\n\nAs the 2020 election inches closer, it will become harder for Democrats to argue that they need to act, rather than let voters decide at the polls.\n\nBut what about Biden? Isn\u2019t it fair for Trump to investigate?\n\nAt the center of Trump\u2019s allegation is a widely debunked theory that Biden \u2013 as vice president under President Barack Obama \u2013 delivered his own quid pro quo to Ukraine to help his son, Hunter, who was serving on the board of a Ukraine gas company, Burisma.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that Biden in 2016 pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, and threatened to withhold nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid if Shokin wasn't removed. But according to testimony by U.S. envoy Kurt Volker and others, Biden\u2019s position was in line with U.S. policy and backed by other international powers that agreed Shokin was ignoring corruption and needed to go.\n\nVolker also testified that it was \"quite possible\" that Ukrainian gas executives believed they were \"buying influence\" through Biden's son by putting him on the board of Burisma. The vice president's son was paid to serve on the board (at one point, his firm collected $166,666 each month from Burisma as both Hunter Biden and his associate sat on the board), and State Department official George Kent testified he warned about a perceived conflict of interest.\nBut no evidence has surfaced that Joe Biden acted to help his son, nor that his Hunter Biden violated any laws, and the Bidens deny any wrongdoing. House Republicans suggest in their Dec. 2 report that Democrats should acknowledge the \"perception of potential wrongdoing\" by Hunter Biden serving on Burisma's board while his father led U.S. policy fighting Ukrainian corruption.\n\nAfter weeks of both closed-door and open depositions, Democrats have moved into the next phase of the impeachment inquiry (here is a list of who testified and what they said).\n\nOn Dec. 3, Democrats were expected to release their summary of events, laying out in detail evidence that suggests the president used his power in office for personal gain and to attack a political rival.\n\nThen on Dec. 4, the inquiry shifts to the House Judiciary Committee, which will hear from lawyers who will testify on whether Congress has grounds under the Constitution to impeach. For the week of Dec. 9, the Judiciary Committee has invited a Democratic lawyer and Republican lawyer to present their cases. It was unclear as of Tuesday whether the White House would participate.\n\nAfter that the Judiciary Committee may draft articles of impeachment and vote on them, followed by a full vote in the House, which requires a simple majority.\n\nImpeachment doesn\u2019t force presidents out of office. It\u2019s more like a political black eye delivered by the House that kicks off a \u201ctrial\u201d in the Senate.\n\nIf that happens, a group of House lawmakers -- all Democrats \u2013 would essentially act as prosecutors and argue the case before the Senate. Trump and his legal team would have equal time to put on their defense, with the Senate acting as a kind of jury.\n\nIf at least two-thirds of the nation\u2019s senators vote against Trump, he would be removed from office \u2013 a high bar in a Senate currently controlled by Republicans. (The Senate doesn\u2019t have the power to send a president to jail, only oust him.)\n\nOne big concern for Democrats \u2013 and a reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed to be initially reluctant to consider impeachment \u2013 is that Trump could be impeached by the House, only to be acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate and possibly come back stronger politically as his base rallies to his defense.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in 1998 when Democrat Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath to try to hide an extra-marital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. While the GOP had clear evidence of the wrongdoing, he was acquitted by the Democratic-controlled Senate and saw a boost in his approval ratings.\n\n(President Andrew Johnson also was impeached and acquitted by the Senate in 1868).\n\nTo hear Democrats tells it, nothing less than the soul of the country is at stake.\n\n\u201cThere comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit of history to take action to protect and preserve the integrity of our nation. I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come,\u201d said Rep. John Lewis., D-Georgia, on the House floor last September. \u201cTo delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy.\u201d\n\nRepublicans like Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry disagree.\n\n\u201cI believe it was inappropriate. I do not believe it was impeachable,\u201d he recently told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nAs for Trump, he says it\u2019s nothing more than \u201cthe Greatest Witch Hunt in American History!\u201d\n\nABC News\u2019 Trish Turner and Mike Levine contributed to this report.\n\nEditor's Note: This version corrects a reference to Clinton to note he had a boost in approval rating after impeachment, but was not up for reelection.
