During conversations with some of the 18 witnesses interviewed throughout the investigation, the IG identified two other female employees who were also allegedly sexually harassed by Roberts.\nThe first employee said Roberts hugged and kissed her when they were alone, even whispering \"I love you\" in her ear and touching her thigh during a social event. That employee also said that Roberts invited her on dates for dinner and drinks, made comments to her about him living alone in an apartment without his wife -- which she perceived as an invitation to be alone together -- and expressed his desire to see her in a bikini.\n\nThe employee told the IG that she expressed to Roberts numerous times that she found the behavior inappropriate and told him to \"stop.\"\nThe second and third employees alleged similar unwanted touching -- with the second employee saying Roberts routinely commented on her \"looks.\"\n\nBoth employees told the IG that they did not report Roberts' behavior because of concerns that it could damage their reputation or negatively impact their careers.\n\n\u201cAs a young female growing up in this business, you have to, whether right or wrong \u2026 be careful about what you say,\" the third employee said, according to the report.\nAsked about the investigation's results during a Pentagon briefing on Thursday, chief spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman said he was not aware of the report.\n\nAccording to his Defense Department biography, Roberts was the principal adviser to senior Pentagon leadership on matters concerning nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, stepping into the role in November 2017.\n\nWhen he abruptly resigned last April, a Pentagon spokesperson declined to provide an explanation for Roberts\u2019s departure in a comment to Foreign Policy.\n\n\u201cThe department\u2019s commitment to modernizing the department\u2019s nuclear force and closely cooperating with allies and partners remains unwavering, and will result in the increased defense of the nation,\u201d said Lt. Col. Mike Andrews, a department spokesperson. \u201cWe appreciate [Roberts'] service to the department and wish him continued success.\u201d\n\nBecause Roberts has already left his post, the IG said they would give the report to the office of the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, for inclusion in Roberts' personnel file.\n"}
