The 631 companies involved held assets worth more than the GDP of the United States and China together last year.\nSeparately, a financial research group said major companies themselves can significantly cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouses gases by making their suppliers switch to renewable energy.\nThe London-based nonprofit group CDP said it analyzed data from thousands of firms that supply big corporations such as Walmart, Samsung and L\u2019Oreal, concluding that shifting a fifth of their energy purchases to renewable sources like wind or solar could reduce emissions by 1 gigaton of carbon dioxide \u2014 or about the combined amount released by Brazil and Mexico in 2017."}
