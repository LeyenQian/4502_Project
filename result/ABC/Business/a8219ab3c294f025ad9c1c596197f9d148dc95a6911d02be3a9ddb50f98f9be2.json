It also was seen as something of a bellwether for how investors view oil and gas companies' prospects in light of global warming and the new regulations it's expected to spur.\nThe lawsuit accused Exxon Mobil of essentially keeping two sets of books \u2014 telling the public that it was fully taking into account the costs of potential future climate regulations in a warming world, while lowballing those costs behind the scenes as it made investment decisions and assessed the value of its oil and gas reserves.\nThe burning of fossil fuels for electricity, transportation and heat is the main source of manmade heat-trapping carbon emissions. Scientists have warned that the world must cut those emissions to stave off the worst effects of warming.\nExxon Mobil has used two different metrics to account for potential carbon costs: a \"proxy cost\" for predicting how regulations worldwide might reduce demand for oil and gas, and a \"greenhouse gas cost\" used to figure how local regulations might affect specific projects.\nIts executives and attorneys said the company applied the appropriate costs depending on the situation. But the attorney general's office said the two-part system added up to minimizing emissions price tags on some oil and gas development projects, making them look more financially attractive. \n\"Exxon applied much lower costs or no costs at all,\" attorney Jonathan Zweig said last month in the state's closing argument after a 12-day trial. \nExxon Mobil said it did nothing wrong, was serious about grappling with climate change and had no incentive to underestimate its future costs.\n\"We knew it was a real issue,\" former CEO and ex-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson testified in October. \"We tried to understand how this was going to affect everything.\u201d\nHe said Exxon Mobil's system for gauging climate risks and costs that was \u201cas robust as we could make it at the time, and continued to try to improve it.\u201d \nThe judge noted there was no testimony from any actual investors who claimed to have been deceived, and he credited the company with \u201ca culture of disciplined analysis, planning, accounting and reporting.\u201d"}
