Despite working around the clock to build the sub in short order, Musk arrived in Thailand late in the rescue effort and the craft was never used.\nUnsworth called it nothing more than a \u201cPR stunt\u201d and said Musk could stick the sub \u201cwhere it hurts.\u201d Musk watched the CNN clip of Unsworth several times before lashing out in a series of tweets July 15, 2018.\n\u201cIt was wrong and insulting, so I insulted him back,\u201d the billionaire told a Los Angeles federal court jury. \u201cIt was an unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids.\u201d\nUnsworth is seeking unspecified damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress from the tech entrepreneur whose net worth exceeds $20 billion.\nMusk\u2019s lawyer, Alex Spiro, said during opening statements that Unsworth deserves nothing for what he called \u201cjoking, taunting tweets in a fight between men.\u201d\nThe shame and mortification Unsworth said he experienced is undercut by the attention he received after the rescue, Spiro said, including honors from the Thai king and British prime minister and offers from agents and film crews.\nMusk, who was dressed in a charcoal gray suit and white shirt, remained composed on the witness stand during questioning from Unsworth\u2019s lawyer, who called him as his first witness.\nHis answers were at times humorous and sometimes seemed like those of an executive under court order to be careful about what he says.\nMusk is required to have his tweets about Tesla screened as part of court settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations he posted misleading information about the company that caused wild stock swings.\nHis tweet about Unsworth caused Tesla\u2019s stock to drop about 3% the following day, though it recovered a day later.\nAfter company officials tried to get Musk to apologize for the tweet, he responded in an email that he didn\u2019t want look \u201cfoolish and craven\u201d by doing so right after the stock dropped.\nMusk projected an air of humility as he was asked about his influence in the world. He said he didn\u2019t think his efforts to address climate change were taken seriously, that few people were aware of his goal to colonize Mars and he didn\u2019t really pay attention to how his fortune stacks up against other billionaires.\nWith his arms crossed, Musk at times squinted and stared off in the distance as he searched for answers to events that occurred more than a year ago.\nHe clashed at one point with attorney L. Lin Wood, telling him he interpreted the lawyer\u2019s letter threatening to sue as a shakedown and extortion attempt.\n\u201cI get these shakedown letters a lot,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI think you\u2019re looking for a significant payday.\u201d\nSpiro attempted to humanize Musk, having him discuss his family \u2014 sets of 15-year-old twins and 13-year-old triplets, all boys. Musk choked up talking about a son who died as a baby and when asked about his childhood in South Africa.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t good,\u201d he said after a long pause.\nMusk said he was asked to help with the cave rescue and decided to get involved when he heard a Thai Navy diver died in the cave system and that a monsoon was forecast that could drown the soccer team.\nMusk received no compensation for his efforts, though he acknowledged his work could have been interpreted as a \u201cnarcissistic\u201d publicity effort.\nMusk deleted the July 15, 2018, tweets and apologized on Twitter, though subsequent statements he made have called into question what he meant.\nMusk responded to a question on Twitter about whether he had accused Unsworth of being a pedophile by saying, \u201cBet ya a signed dollar it\u2019s true.\u201d\nHe told a Buzzfeed reporter seeking comment on the threat of a lawsuit by Unsworth to \u201cstop defending child rapists,\u201d followed by expletives.\nMusk was asked about an almost comical attempt to dig up dirt on Unsworth when it became clear he could be sued.\nOne of his executives created a fake email account to communicate with a man who said he was an investigator, but then signed his own name on a nondisclosure agreement.\nThe investigator turned out to be a con man who was paid $52,000 and produced nothing damning about Unsworth.\nMusk said he didn\u2019t know Unsworth had helped with the rescue when he first tweeted about him and said \u201cpedo guy\u201d wasn\u2019t asserted as a fact.\n\u201cJust as I didn\u2019t literally mean he was a pedophile, I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t literally mean shoving a sub up my ass,\u201d Musk testified, provoking snickers.\nWhen asked about the final line of his email to the Buzzfeed reporter that said he hoped Unsworth would sue him, Musk quipped: \u201cI guess be careful what you wish for.\u201d"}
