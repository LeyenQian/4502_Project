All four were fired Nov. 25 for what Google said were violations of its data security policy.\nCompany officials wrote in a memo \u2014 without confirming the employees\u2019 names \u2014 that the four were \u201csearching for, accessing, and distributing business information outside the scope of their jobs.\u201d\nBut the four workers \u2014 Laurence Berland, Sophie Waldman, Rebecca Rivers and Paul Duke \u2014 say they believe they did not violate company policies and claim that Google is using the alleged violations as an excuse to terminate them for labor activity.\n\u201cThis is an expression of Google\u2019s management power,\u201d Duke said. \u201cThey are scared of worker power.\u201d\nGoogle disputes that they fired the employees for organizing activity.\n\u201cNo one has been dismissed for raising concerns or debating the company\u2019s activities,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nGoogle employees are known for being some of the most outspoken across the tech industry. Thousands of employees         walked out of work last year to protest the company\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct claims, in what became known as the Google Walkout. Since then, employees have petitioned for better benefits for contract workers, successfully argued for the         end of mandatory arbitration and have opposed Google\u2019s involvement in some government projects.\nThe company has also been known for an open, collaborative work culture since its early days, one that employee activists say is now getting closed off.\nCEO Sundar Pichai\u2019s weekly question-and-answer sessions with employees became monthly meetings. Google also updated its community guidelines to tell employees to avoid \u201cdisrupting the workday\u201d to debate politics or other topics. Some workers complain both moves were meant to discourage open speech and crack down on employee pushback.\nWaldman and Duke helped create a petition earlier this year that called for Google to         refrain from bidding on a cloud computing contract with U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. Nearly 1,500 employees signed the petition, which said CBP had \u201cengaged in human rights abuses\u201d at the southern border and that Google should not work with the agency.\nRivers and Berland also helped spread the petition, and Berland has been involved in organizing other campaigns at the company, including those involving LGBTQ rights.\nAll four say they were questioned by Google officials in the past few months for sharing or accessing internal documents. Two say they were placed on administrative leave last month.\nThe company said it found one worker set up notifications to be alerted about other employees\u2019 calendar changes, which made those employees feel unsafe. It said screenshots of their calendars with their names were shared externally.\n\u201cWe have always taken information security very seriously, and will not tolerate efforts to intimidate Googlers or undermine their work, nor actions that lead to the leak of sensitive business or customer information,\u201d read the memo sent by Chris Rackow, Royal Hansen and Heather Adkins from the company\u2019s security and investigations team.\nThe employees said any documents they viewed and shared were already accessible by Google workers, and they only shared them internally. They said others later shared them outside the company.\nThe four fired workers said they received no severance payments. They are working with lawyers and have not yet determined the details of the NLRB complaint, but said it will address retaliation concerns and will likely take issue broadly with Google\u2019s recent policy changes and alleged crackdowns against employee organizing.\nGoogle reached a         separate settlement with the NLRB in September over employees\u2019 ability to speak out about workplace issues. Google agreed to post notices to remind employees of their rights, including the ability to talk to each other about workplace conditions and push for changes such as raises.\nThe situation of the four workers has led to additional protest. A few hundred people attended a rally at Google\u2019s San Francisco office in November to call for Rivers\u2019 and Berland\u2019s reinstatement."}
