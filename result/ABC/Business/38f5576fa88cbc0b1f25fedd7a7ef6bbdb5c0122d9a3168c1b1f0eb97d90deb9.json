Warren didn't name former Vice President Joe Biden or Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, but she was clearly taking aim at them \u2014 suggesting that long-simmering tensions between the party's centrist and progressives wings are boiling over.\n\u201cUnlike some candidates for the Democratic nomination, I'm not counting on Republican politicians having an epiphany and suddenly supporting the kinds of tax increases on the rich or big-business accountability they have opposed under Democratic presidents for a generation,\" Warren said during a speech at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. \u201cUnlike some candidates for the Democratic nomination, I'm not betting my agenda on the naive hope that if Democrats adopt Republican critiques of progressive policies or make vague calls for unity that somehow the wealthy and well-connected will stand down.\"\nThe comments were some of the most strident for a candidate who rode a steady rise in the polls throughout the summer to become a front-runner but lately has seen that support stall as Buttigieg and Biden seem to have grabbed some momentum. \n\u201cWe know that one Democratic candidate walked into a room of wealthy donors this year to promise that \u2018nothing would fundamentally change' if he\u2019s president,\u201d she said, referring to past comments by Biden. Referencing Buttigieg's fundraising prowess, she said, \u201cWe know that another calls the people who raise a quarter million dollars for him his \u2018National Investors Circle,\u2019 and he offers them regular phone calls and special access.\" \n\u201cWhen a candidate brags about how beholden he feels to a group of wealthy investors,\" Warren added, \u201cour democracy is in serious trouble.\u201d \nWarren remains bunched near the top of the polls with Biden, Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the race's other strong progressive voice. But rather than contrasting herself with Sanders to shore up the Democratic left, she has increasingly gone after the mayor and the former vice president \u2014 as well as billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The division is growing as the first votes of the Democratic primary near, and there's mounting concern that no clear front-runner will emerge from the initial slate of contests.\n\u201cNobody is perfect, and nobody is pure. And there\u2019s no question that any Democrat running for president would be better than Donald Trump,\" Warren said Thursday. \u201cBut voters will not trust a candidate who won\u2019t make a single difficult decision that might cut down on the access and influence of wealthy donors. And voters will be right.\"\nIn response to Warren's speech, Buttigieg senior adviser Lis Smith suggested that the senator may ultimately undermine Democratic unity. \n\u201cSen. Warren's idea of how to defeat Donald Trump is to tell people who don\u2019t support her that they are unwelcome in the fight and that those who disagree with her belong in the other party,\" Smith said. \nWarren has centered her candidacy on proposing structural changes to remake the political and economic system. She wants a 2% tax on fortunes worth $50 million-plus and a levy three times that on anyone who has a net worth of more than $1 billion. She pledges to use that tax money to offer universal child care and free tuition at public universities while wiping out most student debt for 42 million Americans and helping finance a \u201cMedicare for All\" plan providing government-sponsored health care nationwide. \nBut some potential hurdles of doing so were on display earlier Thursday, when the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model \u2014 which provides nonpartisan analysis of public policy proposals \u2014 released         findings showing that Warren's wealth tax will raise $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion over 10 years. That's as much as $1.4 trillion less than Warren\u2019s campaign estimates. \nThe analysis also concluded that the new taxes would cause the economy to contract 0.9% to 2.1% by 2050 and says the new tax would reduce \u201cprivate capital formation\u201d enough to drive the U.S. economy\u2019s average wage down 0.9% to 2.3%, even affecting households not rich enough to qualify for the tax.\nWarren\u2019s wealth tax has been among the most popular \u2014 and most scrutinized \u2014 proposals of her campaign. Although Sanders has         proposed an even higher tax on top fortunes,  Warren's has given her an economic populist edge and even prompted crowds at her rallies to break into chants of \u201c2 cents!\u201d \nResponding to the analysis after her New Hampshire speech, Warren said it wasn't really based on what she wants to do, saying the authors \u201cchanged provisions and then analyzed something else.\"\n\u201cI understand there are people who want to throw up a lot of dust around this because they don't really have any comeback to that central question and that is, \u2018Why aren't we asking the folks at the very top to pitch in a couple of cents so that we could actually invest in opportunity and everyone else?'\" she said. \nStill, even Warren herself acknowledged the potential difficulty of her agenda, noting in her speech: \u201cWill I have a magic wand to enact my full agenda? Of course not. No president does. I know I will have to compromise, but that\u2019s not where we start.\"\nShe said she'd exploit Senate procedures allowing some legislation to pass with a simple majority \u2014 noting that Republicans used that to pass the tax cuts championed by Trump. But pulling that off is difficult since the chamber rules would require near-universal Democratic unity. \nButtigieg, appearing on CBS on Thursday, took his own shot at one piece of Warren's policy agenda, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to promise that we can just wave away all student debt.\" \nThe mayor said he personally understands the effects of taking on debt to pay for school but \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean I can just say we\u2019re going to make it all go away and it\u2019s all free now.\u201d\nIn New Hampshire, Warren noted that any Democrat who has \u201cfought for real change\" has been branded a socialist or radical. \n\u201cHere\u2019s a news flash,\" she said. \u201cIf you defend a corrupt system, where corporate lobbyists write the rules to squeeze out competition and hurt economic growth and undercut workers, you\u2019re not a capitalist. You\u2019re just a cheater.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCatch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast,         \u201cGround Game.\u201d     "}
