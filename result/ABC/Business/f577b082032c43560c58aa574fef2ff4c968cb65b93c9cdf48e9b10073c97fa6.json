Those are parties open to anyone and advertised on social media, for example.\nAirbnb says boutique hotels and professional event venues will be exempt from the new rule.\nThe San Francisco-based company is also banning large parties at apartment buildings and condos.\n\u201cThis policy does not impact parties that are authorized by hosts and convened respectfully by guests,\u201d the company said in a news release. \u201cInstead, our goal with this new policy is to address the small number of guests who act irresponsibly and those rare hosts whose homes become persistent neighborhood nuisances.\u201d\nAirbnb says it\u2019s in the process of identifying listings globally that may be violating the party house ban, including accommodations in Los Angeles, Miami Beach, London and Montreal. The company says it\u2019s asking hosts to update their listings to comply with the \u2018\u2019open invite\u201d ban.\nAirbnb is also issuing new guest behavior rules. In early 2020, guests will get a warning for one instance of excessive noise, unauthorized guests, unauthorized parking, unauthorized smoking or excessive messiness reported by a host or a neighbor. Further violations will result in account suspension or removal.\nAirbnb CEO Brian Chesky announced last month that changes would be coming after         five people were killed at a Halloween party shooting in Orinda. The owner of the Airbnb rental didn't authorize the party, which had more than 100 guests.\nAirbnbWatch, a hotel-funded group that calls for stricter local home-sharing regulations, faulted Airbnb for responding only after the Orinda shooting. AirbnbWatch said there have been dozens of shootings at Airbnb rentals over the last six months, and the company isn't doing enough to ensure guest and neighbor safety.\nBut Daniel Guttentag, an assistant professor in the department of hospitality and tourism management at the College of Charleston School of Business, said he thinks the new policies demonstrate Airbnb's genuine intention to rid the platform of some of its most problematic activity. He thinks the rules could also help shield Airbnb from liability if a party goes awry.\n\u201cThe challenge for Airbnb will be enforcing these rules, though, as its immense scale can make that difficult,\u201d Guttentag said. Airbnb has more than 7 million listings worldwide.\nGuttentag said it could also be hard for Airbnb to determine what is \u201ctoo loud\u201d and ensure that neighbors reporting a problem aren't just trying to shut a rental down.\nThe company is under pressure to gain the trust of travelers, neighbors and lawmakers as it prepares for its planned initial public offering next year.\nAirbnb also said Thursday it\u2019s establishing a dedicated hotline for mayors and city officials who have questions about its policies."}
