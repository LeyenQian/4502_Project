The amount available would be more than enough to cover the $20 million price tag for the plant.\nLordstown Motors Corp. announced a month ago that it had bought the the         once-bustling factory near Youngstown that made the Chevrolet Cruze up until last March.\nThe new company wants to begin making electric trucks by late 2020, but it also said that it still needs more investors before manufacturing can begin.\nGM's decision to end production in Lordstown, where it employed 4,500 two years ago, came into the political spotlight after President Donald Trump criticized the plan last year and pushed GM executives to either reopen or sell the plant, At one point, he threatened to cut off all federal subsidies to the automaker.\nGM spokesman Jim Cain said the company wants to help Lordstown Motors stick to its launch schedule and that the company does not expect it would buy the plant back, nor is it an investor in Lordstown Motors. \n\u201cIt's in everyone's best interest in seeing this succeed,\" he said. \nThe loan agreement, first reported by the         The Business Journal in Youngstown, also would give GM the chance to lease land next to the Lordstown plant. \nGM announced last week that it has formed a joint venture with Korea's LG Chem to build an electric vehicle battery cell factory at undisclosed location near Lordstown. \nThe new battery plant will create more than 1,100 jobs, but the exact location hasn't been disclosed.\nLordstown Motors, meanwhile, plans to hire 400 production workers next year so that it can begin limited production of its electric trucks. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThis story corrects the spelling of the Chevrolet Cruze.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press writer Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this report."}
