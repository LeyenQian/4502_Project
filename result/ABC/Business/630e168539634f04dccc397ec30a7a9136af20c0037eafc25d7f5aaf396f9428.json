AWS is one of the largest cloud computing platforms in the nation and currently works with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nAfter being passed off for Microsoft, AWS protested this decision in the Court of Federal Claims, arguing in the filing unsealed Monday that the company was not selected due to \"improper pressure\" from the president.\n\nTrump \"launched repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks\" to steer the contract away from AWS to and to harm Bezos, \"his perceived political enemy,\" the court documents allege.\nDepartment of Defense spokeswoman Elissa Smith declined to comment on specific claims in the litigation, but said the decision-making process was free of \"external influences.\"\n\n\"This source selection decision was made by an expert team of career public servants and military officers from across the Department of Defense and in accordance with DOD's normal source-selection process,\" Smith said in a statement to ABC News.\n\n\"There were no external influences on the source selection decision,\" Smith added. \"The department is confident in the JEDI award and remains focused on getting this critical capability into the hands of our warfighters as quickly and efficiently as possible.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper also defended the Pentagon's decision in a news conference last month, saying that the awarding of the contract was \"conducted fairly.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m confident it was conducted freely and fairly without any type of outside influence,\" he told reporters. \"I will leave it at that.\"\u00a0\n\nTrump had suggested in July that he could intervene in the decision-making process for the contract, saying from the Oval Office, \u201cI'm getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon\" and \"Great companies that are complaining about it, so we\u2019re going to take a look at it. We'll take a strong look at it.\u201d\n\nHis comments led Republican lawmakers in the House Armed Services Committee to send a letter in July warning Trump against intervening.\n"}
