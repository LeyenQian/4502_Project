Several French IS suspects will be returned to France on Dec. 9.\nBut he says the No. 1 problem is not foreign fighters, but in finishing the war against IS.\nTrump told Macron his response was one of the \u201cgreatest non answers\u201d he\u2019s ever heard.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n3:25 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron are criticizing Turkey, which is part of NATO but has taken actions that have angered members of the alliance.\nTrump said Tuesday that he had a great relationship with Turkey, although he said that the U.S. was considering imposing sanctions on Ankara for buying a Russian-made missile defense system.

He alleged that NATO has treated Russia \u201crudely\u201d and refused to take its interests into account.\nPutin says NATO\u2019s expansion and beefing up of its military infrastructure near

in the Arctic region, and that NATO has a role to play in mitigating its impact.\nSolberg says \u201cclimate change is a big insecurity creator\u201d because it leads to more migration and less sustainable development that fuels extremism.\nShe says: \u201cIt\u2019s much less costly to prevent climate change than to adapt to it.\u201d\nShe was speaking in London on Tuesday ahead of a NATO summit.\nSingling out China and the United States, Solberg said the challenges posed by global warming cannot be faced \u201cwithout having the big emitters on board.\u201d\nShe says China continues

alliance was founded in 1949 to provide collective security for Europe against what was then the Soviet Union.\nPeskov said Tuesday that NATO is \u201ca product of the era of confrontation, the Cold War era,\u201d something he says that Russia does not want to return to.\nBut he says that \u201can alliance that was created and shaped by the confrontation ideology, of course, can\u2019t bring anything else\u201d but confrontation.\nTurkey\u2019s increasingly close relations with Moscow \u2014 and its purchase of Russian air defense systems that are incompatible with NATO equipment \u2014 has added to tensions among the allies.\nBut Peskov says those ties are not hurting NATO.\nFrance, meanwhile, also wants closer ties with Russia.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n10:30 a.m.\nPresident Donald

who is unpopular in the U.K., at arms-length ahead of the Dec. 12 elections.\n\"I don't want to complicate it,\u201d Trump told reporters at the start of a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\nTrump added that he\u2019s a \u201cfan\u201d of Brexit and said he knows \u201cnothing\u201d of Johnson\u2019s Labour Party rival, Jeremy Corbyn.\nHe described Johnson as \u201cvery

says French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s recent comments that NATO is experiencing \u201cbrain death\u201d is very insulting to the military alliance\u2019s other 28 members.\nTrump took aim at Macron with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg by his side and called his comments \u201cvery nasty.\u201d\nMacron said the alliance was experiencing \u201cbrain death\u201d in an interview with the Economist published last month, suggesting that the alliance was becoming obsolete.\n\u201cNobody needs NATO more than France,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump has repeatedly criticized fellow NATO members and complained that too few nations are on track to meet the alliance goal of spending at least 2% of GDP on defense by 2024.\nTrump also lashed out at France for a digital service tax that he said unfairly discriminates against U.S. tech companies, including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.\nRobert Lighthizer, the chief U.S. trade representative, on Monday recommended the U.S. respond

fighters.\nBefore departing to attend a NATO leaders\u2019 summit in London, Erdogan said he would discuss the issue with the leaders of Poland and the Baltics during the gathering that marks the alliance's 70th birthday.\nA plan to defend the Baltic nations in case of a Russian attack requires all member states\u2019 backing.\nTurkey has accused NATO allies of backing Baltic countries' security concerns but dismissing threats to Turkey from the Kurdish fighters.\nTurkey considers the Kurdish fighters to be terrorists and invaded parts of northeast Syria to drive them away from its border."}
