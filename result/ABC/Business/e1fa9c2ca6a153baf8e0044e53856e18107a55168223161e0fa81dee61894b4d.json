U.S. authorities say the company is a security risk, which Huawei denies, and announced curbs in May on its access to American components and technology.\nThe Trump administration announced a 90-day reprieve on some sales to Huawei. The government said that would apply to components and technology needed to support wireless networks in rural areas.\nRen gave no details but Huawei confirmed in June it had cut 600 jobs at its Silicon Valley research center in Santa Clara, California, leaving about 250 employees. A Huawei spokesman said the company had no further comment.\n\u201cThe research and development center will move from the United States, and Canada will be the center,\u201d Ren said in a video excerpt of the interview on the Globe and Mail website. \u201cAccording to the U.S. ban, we couldn\u2019t communicate with, call, email or contact our own employees in the United States.\u201d\nHuawei, China\u2019s first global tech brand, is scrambling to preserve its business in the face of possible loss of access to U.S. components, which threatens to damage its smartphone business.\nHuawei, headquartered in the southern city of Shenzhen, also operates research and development centers in Germany, India, Sweden and Turkey.\nIn November, Huawei started selling a folding smartphone, the Mate X, made without U.S.-supplied processor chips or Google apps. The company also has unveiled its own smartphone operating system it says can replace Google\u2019s Android if necessary."}
