However, Egyptian officials are concerned that filing the reservoir behind the dam could significantly reduce the amount of Nile water available to Egypt. \nThe joint statement said that the rules and guidelines developed for the operation of the dam would include ways to mitigate drought conditions based upon the natural flow of the Nile and water release rates from the dam\u2019s reservoir.\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly this fall, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said he would never allow Ethiopia to impose a \u201cde facto situation\u201d by filling the dam without an agreement on its operation.\n\u201cWhile we acknowledge Ethiopia\u2019s right to development, the water of the Nile is a question of life, a matter of existence to Egypt,\u201d he said."}
