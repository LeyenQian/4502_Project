While that pushed markets down, a subsequent report from Bloomberg News cited officials saying that the two sides are inching closer to a deal.\nInvestors hope for at least enough progress to stave off new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, including smartphones and laptops, scheduled to start Dec. 15.\nTensions flared last week after Trump signed legislation expressing U.S. support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong.\n\u201cThe trade war will be the key driver of sentiment in the immediate few weeks,\u201d said DBS Group analysts in a report.\nGermany\u2019s DAX rose 1.1% to 13,125 while London\u2019s FTSE 100 was steady at 7,151. France\u2019s CAC 40 advanced 1.2% to 5,795.\nOn Wall Street, futures for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average were 0.5% higher.\nNegotiators have yet to agree on details of an interim deal Trump has called \"Phase 1.\"\nInvestors also are weighing the potential for additional trade disputes.\nOn Tuesday, Trump proposed tariffs on $2.4 billion in French products in retaliation for a tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook. That follows a threat Monday to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum from Argentina and Brazil.\nEarlier, in Asia, Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 index sank 1.1% to close at 23,135.23 and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gave up 1.3% to 26,062.56.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.2% to 2,878.13 and Seoul\u2019s Kospi declined 0.7% to 2,068.89.
