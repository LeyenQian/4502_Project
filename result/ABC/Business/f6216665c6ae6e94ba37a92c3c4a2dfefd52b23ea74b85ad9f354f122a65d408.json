It should have said his last name was Fenter, not Fenton.\nA corrected version of the story is below:\nIconic Southern rock recording studio is revived in Georgia\nThe Georgia music studio that fused blues, country and other sounds into Southern rock is being reborn\nBy JEFF MARTIN\nAssociated Press\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The Georgia music studio that fused blues, country and other sounds into Southern rock is being reborn.\nCapricorn Sound Studios in Macon helped propel the Allman Brothers Band and other groups to stardom in the 1970s.\nCapricorn\u2019s historic Studio A is reopening this week, after years of work by Mercer University and other supporters to restore and equip it with state-of-the-art technology.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place that spawned a decade of remarkable creative activity,\u201d Mercer President William Underwood said in an interview.\nIt also helped make Macon one of the nation\u2019s music capitals. Underwood hopes the renovated studio will help preserve Macon\u2019s place among cities that forged the music history of the United States \u2014 places like Nashville and Memphis in Tennessee, Muscle Shoals in Alabama and Detroit, Chicago and New Orleans.\nMacon\u2019s civic leaders view Southern rock through a far different lens these days than in the 1970s.\nSouthern rockers and Southern Baptists traveled in different orbits back then. The Capricorn music scene \u2014 part of the drug-infused counterculture movement of the time \u2014 was not always welcome in conservative Middle Georgia.\nNow, Capricorn and Southern rock are officially sanctioned by today\u2019s leaders, many of whom were fans in their younger days. Underwood, for instance, grew up listening to Southern rock and considers The Allman Brothers Band \u201cthe greatest jam band ever.\u201d\nIn planning the new music complex, Underwood and others visited music hubs including Nashville, where Elvis Presley and others recorded their hits in RCA\u2019s Studio B.\n\u201cThere are people all over the world who travel to see these restored studios,\u201d said Larry Brumley, a senior vice president at Mercer.\nMacon-area officials hope the restoration \u2014 funded with help from two charitable foundations and other private donors \u2014 will help spur downtown redevelopment.\nThe restored Macon studio is part of Mercer Music at Capricorn, a 20,000-square-foot (1,860-square-meter) complex that will include a museum. Among its goals: To train and inspire new musicians. To that end, the Capricorn Music Incubator will provide 12 rehearsal rooms for musicians to hone their craft.\nThe idea is \u201cto be a place to bring talented, creative people together and have them interact and engage with one another,\u201d Underwood said.\n\u201cOne day hopefully the next Otis Redding will come out of that incubator,\u201d he said.\nRedding\u2019s voice became emblematic of Macon music six decades ago, after Mercer University student Phil Walden discovered his vocal talents while booking local bands for fraternity parties.\nIn 1969, Capricorn Records was formed by Walden and others, including Frank Fenter and producer Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records.\n\u201cMy father loved the South, he loved Georgia and he especially loved Macon,\u201d Phil Walden\u2019s daughter, Amantha, said at Tuesday\u2019s dedication ceremony. \u201cHe loved Southern music deep inside his soul.\u201d\n\u201cMy father\u2019s life mission was to show the world what the South was capable of, and today we are here to celebrate a chapter of that mission,\u201d she added.\nWalden, his brother Alan Walden and their business partners discovered new artists who went on to create what became Southern rock.\nThe Charlie Daniels Band, the Marshall Tucker Band, Elvin Bishop, Wet Willie and others recorded songs inside the studio that was built for the Capricorn record label.\nThe Allman Brothers Band became so popular that they helped a former Georgia governor named Jimmy Carter win the 1976 presidential election by performing at campaign events, Carter has said. Carter told Mercer graduates at their 2016 commencement that he might not have been elected if the band hadn\u2019t \u201cadopted\u201d him.\n\u201cGregg Allman was better known than I was at that time,\u201d Carter said in 2017. \u201cThe band got the campaign political attention and raised much needed funds.\u201d\nWhen Underwood became Mercer\u2019s president, the vacant offices that once housed Capricorn were a shambles, with one exception.\n\u201cThe studio itself \u2014 that magical place where this great music was made \u2014 was still intact,\u201d Underwood recalled. \u201cIt was kind of a miracle.\u201d\nA second venue, Studio B, will be used for larger-scale recordings and to host concerts and other special events. Film scores could be recorded there, tying into Georgia\u2019s booming movie industry, Underwood said.\nThe studio will also feature a custom-built, 40-channel analog sound board that was created by the Maryland-based company API, he said.\nWes Griffith, who now manages the newly restored studio, recalls the first time he stepped inside.\n\u201cI was in awe, standing there where all these great things happened, all this great music was made,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dream come true for me to be the steward of that place and share that history and start a new beginning.\u201d"}
