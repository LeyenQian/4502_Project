Greece has already expelled the Libyan ambassador over it.\nIn the statement, the leaders say the Turkey-Libya agreement \u201cinfringes upon the sovereign rights of third states, does not comply with the Law of the Sea and cannot produce any legal consequences for third states.\u201d \nThe text, seen Thursday by The Associated Press and drawn up for a two-day EU summit underway in Brussels, was a draft so its exact wording could change. \nThe draft document continues that the EU \u201cunequivocally reaffirms its solidarity with Greece and Cyprus regarding these actions by Turkey.\u201d Turkey already angered the EU by drilling for gas in waters off the divided island nation of Cyprus. \nAnkara upped the ante in that dispute on Wednesday by confirming that it would use its military forces if necessary to halt any exploratory gas drilling in waters off Cyprus that it claims to be its own.\nNeighbors Greece and Turkey are divided by a series of decades-old issues, including territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea. The NATO allies have come to the brink of war three times since the 1970s, including once over drilling rights in the Aegean.\nGreece insists the deal with Libya \u2014 which has no fully functioning government able to rule across all of its territory \u2014 is unenforceable and has stressed that it will protect its sovereign rights. Like its EU partners, Greece recognizes the United Nations endorsed Libyan government based in Tripoli.\nThe speaker of Libya\u2019s parliament, which is affiliated with the government based in the country's east, is visiting the Greek capital. Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias was to meet with the speaker, Aguila Saleh, in Athens on Thursday. \nAsked whether Greece would seek to have sanctions to be imposed on Libya over its border pact with Turkey, a Greek diplomatic official said Athens was examining all options, but did not want to take any action that could harm the Libyan people. \nGreece considers the recent developments an escalation the government thinks it did not do anything to provoke, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues. \nAthens is also seeking more involvement in the international discussions over the situation in Libya, and is keeping its channels of communication with Turkey open, the official said. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBecatoros reported from Athens."}
