While Zelenskiy has made ending the conflict a priority, the political novice arrives at the table with the veteran Kremlin leader in what appears to be a less-advantageous position:\n\u2014 Zelenskiy still hasn't had the White House meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump that he sought to bolster his stature on the world stage.\n\u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron, the host of the meeting, has made clear recently that he wants to re-engage with Russia and get back to doing business again after five years of sanctions imposed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine.\n\u2014 Macron and the other mediator in the talks, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, will be meeting Zelenskiy for the first time since it emerged that he criticized them in the July 25 phone call that has become the focus of an impeachment investigation against Trump.\nSo there are concerns among those who support Ukraine's sovereignty that Zelenskiy might end up giving too many concessions to Putin. That could lead to a backlash from Ukrainians who strongly oppose any rapprochement with Russia.\nThe talks are being organized in the so-called Normandy Format, which was launched soon after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and its backing of the separatists in eastern Ukraine. The consultations had stalled since 2016 but have been revived following Zelenskiy's election. \n\u201cThere is a whole cocktail of economics and geopolitics that make the situation for Ukraine very difficult and is posing lot of challenges,\" said Bruno Lete, a security expert at the German Marshal Fund of the U.S., a leading think tank. \n\u201cBut it\u2019s critical that Europeans and the U.S. support Ukraine,\u201d Lete argued. \"Without peace and stability in Ukraine, there will never be peace and stability in Europe.\u201d\nThe biggest challenge for Kyiv probably comes from France itself, with Macron speaking recently of the \u201cbrain death\u201d of NATO because of a lack of coordination and leadership from Washington and also saying he wants to re-engage with Russia. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like telling Russia, \u2018I will work with you and we\u2019ll see about Ukraine,\u2019\u201d Lete said. \u201cHe should have waited until after the Normandy meeting. It doesn\u2019t help the cause of European security.\u201d\nThe Normandy Format talks had have also been revived following several confidence-building steps between Moscow and Kyiv, including prisoner swaps and troop withdrawals by both sides.\nOn Sunday, Pope Francis said he was praying for the talks to bring peace \"to that territory and its population.\u201d\nTaras Kuzio, a security expert and professor at National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy, said Zelenskiy has already weakened his own position by agreeing to the talks even though Russia insists Crimea is non-negotiable. \nKuzio described the 41-year-old Zelenskiy, until recently a comedic actor, as \u201cextremely na\u00efve about international relations\u201d and said he will find himself in a difficult place \u2014 facing a tough opponent in Putin and a population that would reject any capitulation to Moscow.\nHe said Zelenskiy doesn\u2019t grasp that the Russian leader will never compromise over the conflict in eastern Ukraine because \u201cfor Putin, compromise is a defeat.\u201d \nAnd Macron\u2019s pursuit of a reset with Moscow doesn't help Ukraine either. \n\u201cThe danger is that Zelenskiy will be ambushed by Macron working in effect for Putin because his new agenda is to repair relations with Russia, to get back to a normal relationship, get back to doing business,\u201d Kuzio said. \nDespite the challenges, Ukraine still has the support from the European Union, its biggest foreign donor, while Merkel has strongly supported sanctions on Russia. \nBut Germany's longer-term economic interests are a continual challenge for Ukraine.\nBerlin is seen as having harmed Ukraine's interests by moving forward with the completion of a Russian-German gas pipeline called Nord Stream 2 that will bring Russian natural gas to Western Europe. Its route bypasses Ukraine, cutting off its leverage as a transit country and an income source. \nGermany's relationship with Moscow has been complicated by last week's expulsion of two Russian diplomats over the brazen killing of a Georgian national in Berlin in August, with prosecutors suggesting the slaying was either ordered by Russia or authorities in the republic of Chechnya.\nZelenskiy also isn't helped by the revelations in the July 25 phone call with Trump. A rough transcript of the call revealed him accusing Merkel and Macron of giving too little help to Ukraine. At one point, Zelenskiy tells Trump: \u201cWhen I was speaking to Angela Merkel, she talks Ukraine, but she doesn't do anything.\u201d \nAt the time of the call, the White House was withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to Kyiv, adding to Ukraine's fears that the U.S. was turning its back on the vulnerable nation.\nUkrainian suspicions that the West cares more about doing business with Russia than Ukraine's sovereignty go back to when the former Soviet republic declared its independence in 1991.\nA diplomatic cable written in 2009 by then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor described frustration by Kyiv's political elite. The Ukrainians believed Berlin was an \"obstacle in their drive towards EU and NATO membership,\u201d Taylor wrote in the cable, which has been published by Wikileaks.\nTaylor, now the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who testified in the impeachment hearings in Congress, cited a colorful formulation by Ukraine\u2019s former National Security and Defense Council Chairman Volodymyr Horbulin which underscored that. \nTaylor wrote that Horbulin joked that there are two Russian embassies in Kyiv, but \u201cone speaks German.\"\nVadim Karasev, head of the Institute of Global Strategies, an independent Kyiv-based think tank, said the Europeans \"have grown tired of Kyiv\u2019s endless problems and are increasingly looking at Moscow, which has all the instruments to leverage the situation.\u201d \n\u201cThey increasingly remind Kyiv about delayed reforms and corruption instead of talking about solidarity and a common European home,\u201d Karasev said.\nEuropean powers, he said, \"can\u2019t endlessly deal with Kyiv\u2019s problems when they have their own issues to solve.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nAssociated Press writer Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv contributed to this report."}
