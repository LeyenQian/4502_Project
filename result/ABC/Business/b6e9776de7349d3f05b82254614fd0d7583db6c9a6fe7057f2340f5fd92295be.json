The ride-hailing company noted that drivers and riders were both attacked and that some assaults occurred between riders.\nThe Thursday report, which the company hailed as the first of its kind, provides a rare look into the traffic deaths, murders and reported sexual assaults that took place during billions of rides arranged in the U.S. using Uber's service. It is part of the company's effort to be more transparent after years of criticism over its safety record.\nIn 2017, the company counted 2,936 reported sexual assaults \u2014 including 229 rapes \u2014 during 1 billion U.S. trips. Uber bases its numbers on reports from riders and drivers, meaning the actual numbers could be much higher. Sexual assaults commonly go unreported.\n\u201cI suspect many people will be surprised at how rare these incidents are; others will understandably think they\u2019re still too common,\u201d Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi         tweeted about the report. \u201cSome people will appreciate how much we\u2019ve done on safety; others will say we have more work to do. They will all be right.\u201d\nUber's share price dropped more than 1% in after-hours trading.\nUber and competitor Lyft have faced harsh criticism for not doing enough to protect the safety of their riders and drivers. Dozens of women are suing Lyft, claiming the company should have done more to protect them from driver assaults. A Connecticut woman         sued Uber last month, claiming she was sexually assaulted by her driver.\nLondon         refused to renew Uber's license to operate in the city in November after the company was plagued with safety issues including concerns about impostor drivers. Uber said it will appeal the decision.\nThe companies have both formed partnerships with sexual assault prevention networks and other safety groups, and have touted their background check policies for drivers. But many say they haven't gone far enough to protect passengers and drivers, who are contract workers for the companies.\n\u201cKeeping this information in the dark doesn\u2019t make anyone safer,\u201d Uber said in a statement announcing the report. It plans to release its safety report every two years going forward.\nLyft said last year it would also release a safety report. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that it \"remained committed\" to releasing a report, but did not say when it would be released.\nMike Bomberger, a lawyer representing more than 100 victims of sexual assault in lawsuits against Uber and Lyft, applauded Uber for releasing the numbers. \u201cOne of the problems with both of these companies is that they have hidden and have tried to conceal the number of sexual assaults that occur in their vehicles,\u201d he said.\nIn response, an Uber spokesperson pointed to the just-released report. Lyft called Bomberger's charge \u201cbaseless.\u201d\nBomberger said he believes 80% to 90% of the assaults in the Uber report could have been prevented by measures such as cameras in the cars recording rides and the companies reporting every assault they learn of to the police.\nThe Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network said it appreciated Uber's transparency.\n\"This is an issue that affects every institution in America,\" RAINN press secretary Emily Robinson said in a statement. She added that organizations in every industry, including education, should \"make a similar effort to track and analyze sexual misconduct within their communities.\u201d\nThe report stated that Uber rides were involved in 97 reported crashes in 2017 and 2018, resulting in 107 deaths. The company said the figure represents about half of the national rate for fatal crashes.\nSexual assault in the report is defined broadly into categories including non-consensual kissing of a non-sexual body part, attempted non-consensual sexual penetration, non-consensual touching of a sexual body part, non-consensual kissing of a sexual body part and non-consensual sexual penetration.\nThe company also said Uber rides were involved in nine murders during 2018, and 10 during 2017. Uber noted that the vast majority \u2014 99.9% \u2014 of its rides had no reported safety issues. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThis story has been updated to correct the number of rapes reported by Uber in 2018. It is 235, not 229. "}
