I'm no longer afraid of the unknown.\"\n\nShe expressed gratitude for the support of Huawei employees and customers.\n\n\"Every time I appear in court, a crowd waits outside,\" she said. \"Your passion and support have always warmed my heart.\"\nMeng's arrest stems from fraud charges involving Huawei and subsidiaries regarding alleged dealings with Iran, a violation of EU and US sanctions. She faces extradition to the U.S.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Canada has repeatedly called for the immediate release of Meng.\n\n\u201cThis is not a merely judicial case, but a political persecution against a Chinese high-tech enterprise,\u201d the embassy said in a statement on its website in March.\n\nMeng is the daughter of Ren Zhengfei, who founded Huawei, the largest telecommunications equipment producer in the world.
