{"Title": "Holidays bring phishing scam surge aimed at small business", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/holidays-bring-phishing-scam-surge-aimed-small-business-67492164", "Article": "\nThe email looked legitimate, so Danielle Radin clicked on the link it contained, expecting to have her products included in a holiday gift guide.\n\u201cI instantly regretted it,\u201d says Radin, owner of Mantra Magnets, a website that sells wellness products. \u201cIt took me to some random website that looked like those pop-ups telling you that you\u2019ve won the lottery.\u201d\nWithin days of that click three weeks ago, Radin began getting notifications that people in Ecuador, China and elsewhere were trying to access her email account. She wasn\u2019t surprised; she knew her San Diego-based small business had been the target of a phishing scam.\nWhile cybercriminals strike at any time of the year, they\u2019re particularly active during the holiday and income tax filing seasons when computer users expect to see more emails \u2014 and scammers are increasingly targeting individual small businesses with phishing scams, sending messages that look legitimate but do harm instead. An unsuspecting owner or employee clicks on a link or attachment and like Radin finds that malicious software has invaded their PCs.\nCybersecurity experts find that criminals who used to blanket thousands of computer users in hopes of fooling a handful have refined their methods. Scammers find small businesses through websites, social media sites and by combing email address books. They also mine personal data from breaches at retailers and other large companies. Then, using a process called social engineering, they construct emails that increasingly look realistic, as if they truly come from a boss, colleague, friend, potential client or vendor, a bank and even the IRS.\n\u201cIn the last year or two they\u2019ve been running more professional campaigns,\u201d says Perry Toone, owner of Thexyz, an email service provider based in Toronto. \u201cIt can take a couple of minutes for me to determine that they\u2019re phishing scams. That tells me they\u2019re doing a very good job.\u201d\nRadin believes the scammers found her through her website or a blog. Like many small businesses, she has an email address on her site, and the scammers figured out that she might be interested in selling via a holiday gift guide. But finding a target is one thing; the scam won\u2019t work unless it tricks an email recipient into clicking. Even those who are tech savvy can sometimes let their guard down. Radin was duped even though she\u2019s the author of \u201cEveryone\u2019s Been Hacked,\u201d a book sold online.\nOften a scam succeeds because there\u2019s just a shred of doubt in a computer user \u2014 the email is realistic enough that an owner or employee feels they need to read it. Sometimes a staffer clicks out of fear or a sense of responsibility, says Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Heinz College.\n\u201cIt might not sound very personal, but you have an idea that you should go ahead \u2014 you feel like the email is coming from the boss,\u201d he says.\nComputer users may not be looking as closely as they should at an email \u2014 there can be subtle signs that a message is trouble. Terry Cole, owner of Cole Informatics, a company whose work includes cybersecurity, recalls getting an email that truly seemed to be from a colleague. He was one of several people in the industry to receive it.\n\u201cIt said that this colleague had sent me a secure private message that was ready for me to read and included a link to click. This was absolutely consistent with my normal experiences communicating with him,\u201d says Cole, whose company is located in Parsons, Tennessee.\nCole didn\u2019t do in that instance what he usually does and advises everyone to do: check the email address to be sure it\u2019s completely correct. When he clicked on the link, it took him to a bogus website claiming to be connected with Microsoft and asking him for his ID and password. He went no further and suffered no damage to his PC.\nThe holidays provide scammers with extra opportunities: emailed greeting cards, package shipment notices, offers of discounts \u2014 all of them false. Cybercriminals also seek personal information from owners and employees under the guise of needing them to create a W-2 or 1099 tax form; at this time of year, business owners\u2019 thoughts are turning to taxes.\n\u201cSomething that claims to know you, your name, where you work and wants you to take some action is harder to spot,\u201d says Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company based in Sunnyvale, California.\nA common scam at holiday time is an email purportedly from the boss telling a staffer to go buy gift cards and email the numbers back, DeGrippo says.\n\u201cWhen it appears to come from a boss or CEO, I think there is that tendency among employees to follow those directions. They\u2019re playing on their emotions,\u201d she says.\nOften, a scam succeeds in getting an employee to click on a personal email while on a company PC \u2014 many workers check their personal email while at work. Even though the email came through on a personal message, it\u2019s the company\u2019s machine that can be infected.\nCompanies can protect themselves in part by restricting employees\u2019 access to personal email sites, Telang says. He also suggests seminars to help staffers understand the risks that even legitimate-looking emails can present.\nSome of the scams aim at monitoring a user\u2019s keystrokes. So anyone accessing a company or personal account of any sort can be giving a criminal access to their money or sensitive personal data. One tool to prevent a bank account from being emptied or a credit card maxed out is to have accounts with multifactor authentication; that requires a password and a separate code sent to a different device and that is different for each login.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at         www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg.
