Retailers from Amazon to Walgreens also regularly suction up your transaction history to         steer future spending and hold your loyalty.\nNow banks, too, want to turn data they already have on your spending habits into extra revenue by identifying likely customers for retailers. Banks are increasingly aware that they could be sitting on a gold mine of information that can be used to predict \u2014 or sway \u2014 where you spend. Historically, such data has been used mostly for fraud protection.\nSuppose you were to treat yourself to lunch on Cyber Monday, the busiest online shopping day of the year. If you order ahead at Chipotle \u2014 paying, of course, with your credit card \u2014 you might soon find your bank dangling 10% off lunch at Little Caesars. The bank would earn fees from the pizza joint, both for showing the offer and processing the payment.\nWells Fargo began customizing retail offers for individual customers on Nov. 21, joining Chase, Bank of America, PNC, SunTrust and a slew of smaller banks.\nUnlike Google or Facebook, which         try to infer what you\u2019re interested in buying based on your searches, web visits or likes, \u201cbanks have the secret weapon in that they actually know what we spend money on,\u201d said Silvio Tavares of the trade group CardLinx Association, whose members help broker purchase-related offers. \u201cIt\u2019s a better predictor of what we\u2019re going to spend on.\u201d\nWhile banks say they\u2019re moving cautiously and being mindful of privacy concerns, it\u2019s not clear that consumers are fully aware of what their banks are up to.\nBanks know many of our deepest, darkest secrets \u2014 that series of bills paid at a cancer clinic, for instance, or that big strip-club tab that you thought stayed in Vegas. A bank might suspect someone\u2019s adulterous affair long before the betrayed partner would.\n\u201cTen years ago, your bank was like your psychiatrist or your minister \u2014 your bank kept secrets,\u201d said Ed Mierzwinski, a consumer advocate at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Now, he says, \u201cthey think they are the same as a department store or an online merchant.\u201d\nThe startup Cardlytics, one of the field\u2019s pioneers, runs the offer programs for Wells Fargo, Chase and other banks. Though these partnerships, Cardlytics says it gets insights on about $2.8 trillion worth of annual consumer spending worldwide.\nA Cardlytics rival named Augeo runs a similar program with other banks, which it declined to name. American Express has an in-house program for its cardholders. Visa targets offers on Uber\u2019s app for credits toward rides and food delivery.\nEven though banks only know where you\u2019ve shopped \u2014 and not specifically what you bought \u2014 they\u2019re often able to make educated guesses. After all, it\u2019s not likely you\u2019re at a liquor store for the potato chips.\nThe bank can then infer other things you may like. It would have a pretty good idea that you\u2019re about to travel if you\u2019ve charged a flight or hotel stays. HSBC is looking into using that data to set up automatic alerts, so that it wouldn\u2019t decline your card use as fraudulent when you start charging for meals in Kathmandu or Karachi.\nThe next step is to make location-specific offers, perhaps for a car rental, as soon as you land. Marcos Meneguzzi, HSBC\u2019s U.S. head of cards and unsecured lending, said cardholders will welcome such offers, at least when they\u2019re relevant. But he warns that banks could easily overstep and lose their customers\u2019 trust.\nMany of these efforts remain in their infancy, and it\u2019s not yet clear how well they\u2019ll catch on. The Cardlytics programs, for instance, don\u2019t push offers through notifications. You have to look for them in your banking app or website.\nAbeer Bhatia, an executive with Chase\u2019s credit-card business, said commissions barely cover operational costs. To Chase, the program is more important for incentivizing rewards-conscious consumers to use its cards. If a Chase card gets you an extra 10% at Rite Aid, why pull out your Citi card?\nAs far as these companies are concerned, Americans have repeatedly demonstrated that they value freebies and discounts more than intangible privacy concerns.\n\u201cConsumers understand the banks are giving them ways to save money based on how they shop,\u201d said Scott Grimes, CEO and co-founder of Cardlytics.\nBut banks often don\u2019t explain clearly what they\u2019re doing with your data, even though they sometimes share your transactions with outside data companies such as Cardlytics to process offers. And many banks don\u2019t seek explicit consent, instead including these programs by reference in general agreements for the card or online banking.\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally long, and people don\u2019t read that,\u201d said Saisattha Noomnual, a graduate student in Chicago who gets targeted offers through her Chase and Bank of America cards.\nUnder federal law, banks merely have to let you withdraw from marketing, or opt out. That\u2019s difficult to do if you\u2019re not aware it\u2019s happening.\nNoomnual said she can only guess she gets more offers for Starbucks because she visits Starbucks a lot. She reasons that based on how well banks analyze her spending for fraud alerts. While she said she doesn\u2019t mind that, she wishes banks were more forthcoming.\nBank of America declined comment. Chase said it tries to keep disclosures simple and understandable without overwhelming consumers.\nBanks insist they don\u2019t share personal information with other companies because they replace names with anonymous ID numbers. Privacy researchers, however, have         shown that such data can be \u201cde-anonymized\u201d under the right conditions.\nPrivacy advocates worry that past transactions could come back to haunt you. Frequent visits to fast-food joints might flag you as a health risk, which could be a problem if your health insurer could pay to learn about that. Auto insurers might grow wary of cardholders who run up large bar tabs.\nAnd ultimately, these targeted offers could inadvertently encourage people to overspend or double down on unhealthy habits such as fast food.\n\u201cConsumers aren\u2019t aware of the subtle nudges apps are giving them to buy, buy, buy,\u201d Mierzwinski said. \u201cThey are basically digging deep into your psyche and figuring out how to manipulate you.\u201d"}
