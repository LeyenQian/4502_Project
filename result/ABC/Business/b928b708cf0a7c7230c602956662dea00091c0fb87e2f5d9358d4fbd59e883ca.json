{"Title": "Financial fraud more fraught when perpetrator is known", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/financial-fraud-fraught-perpetrator-67498249", "Article": "\nWhen it comes to identity theft and other financial fraud, the perpetrator is sometimes close to home. \nWhile people worry about having their identity or money stolen by strangers online, family, friends and acquaintances are increasingly the ones stealing and profiting from personal information, according to one survey. This creates a tricky and potentially expensive situation for victims to resolve. \nExperts say theft by a family member or acquaintance is vastly underreported. \nThe National Crime Victimization Survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics from 2016 found that just 6% of all victims of identity theft knew something about the offender. But another more recent report by Javelin Research & Strategy, which surveyed 5,000 adults, found that the number of victims who knew the offender in cases of identity theft spiked to 15% in 2018 from 7% in 2017. Because victims were hesitant to report the crime, about three-quarters of these victims personally bore all or some liability for the fraud that occurred. \nExperts said that victims generally do not report the fraud because they don\u2019t want to get friends or family in trouble with the law or cause personal rifts. They often feel some shame and embarrassment that it occurred. And in some cases \u2014 such as with children or the elderly \u2014 they may be unaware or reliant upon the perpetrator. \nAxton Betz-Hamilton is an authority on the topic \u2014 both personally and professionally. \nGrowing up, Betz-Hamilton watched her parents struggle unsuccessfully for years to resolve cases of identity theft. At 19, she discovered that her own identity had been stolen years earlier. It took Betz-Hamilton about eight years to straighten out her credit report.\nThe cruelest twist came  after her mother\u2019s death in 2013, when she and her father discovered that her mother had been the culprit \u2014 taking an estimated $600,000 combined from Betz-Hamilton, her father and grandfather through various misdeeds. \nShe has turned the formidable experience into a career. Betz -Hamilton is now an assistant professor of consumer affairs at South Dakota State University, where she focuses on issues such as family financial abuse, child identity theft and elderly financial exploitation. \nShe also wrote a book \u201cThe Less People Know About Us\u201d about her personal experience. \nSince the book\u2019s publication earlier this year, Betz-Hamilton has heard from other victims around the globe \u2014 some with stories more extreme than hers. In many cases involving other forms of abuse. \nStill, Betz-Hamilton and other experts say many fraud victims are ashamed to come forward. \n\u201cIt is exceptionally underreported,\u201d said Charity Lacey, spokeswoman for the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that focuses on supporting victims. \n\u201cThere are all these justifications that can happen on the part of the victim as to why they will allow that known perpetrator identity crime to happen,\u201d she said. \nHere are a few ways you help prevent or recover from familiar fraud: \nPREVENTION\nIt pays to protect yourself in some of the ways you would from any identity theft. \nFreeze your credit, which restricts access to your credit file. It\u2019s free, easy and will essentially halt someone from opening any new credit in your name. \nWhile you are at it, freeze your children\u2019s credit too and urge elderly loved ones to do the same. Experts say children and the elderly are often targeted because they\u2019re vulnerable and the activity goes undetected. It\u2019s not just family but friends and acquaintances who take advantage of access to personal information. \nStore personal information and documents such as Social Security cards, passports and birth certificates in a safe place. Shred sensitive documents and keep information on electronic devices protected. Monitor your credit reports regularly for any unusual activity. \nVet anyone who may be in your home regularly \u2014 such as caregivers or other service providers. Don\u2019t leave personal information out \u2014 such as bank statements \u2014 if you are expecting others in your home. \nBe selective about who you trust to maintain your finances in old age or in disability. Consider putting checks and balances in place with a financial professional or multiple trusted people as a safeguard to keep each in check. \nRECOGNIZE\nKeep an eye out for signs of fraudulent activity. \nReview your bank and credit card statements closely. Look out for signs of new account activity \u2014 this could include bills for items you didn\u2019t buy, debt collection calls for or denial for loan applications. Credit card applications arriving in the mail for a minor are another giveaway. \nPay close attention if an elderly loved one is  reliant on others for their care as this is when they are most susceptible. Look out for changes in financial activity or activity they cannot explain. Additionally, take note if items are missing from their home. Also notice if a caregiver shows a change in lifestyle \u2014 quitting a job or buying big ticket items for instance. \nJavelin Strategy & Research found that fraud cases show an uptick around economic downturns as people grow desperate. \nKyle Marchini, who co-authored the firm\u2019s report on identity theft, refers to need as one corner of a \u201cfraud triangle,\u201d with opportunity and rationalization as the other two corners. \nFor example, sometimes a family member might use another\u2019s information to get a loan to pay the rent. While that is easier to rationalize than a spending spree, it\u2019s still a crime. \nREPORT\nA big hurdle for victims is the emotional betrayal of someone they trust. Then comes the question of whether to report it. \nThere\u2019s a lot of guilt and shame about \u2018\u2019I should have known better\u2019,\u201d said Lacey of the Identity Theft Resource Center. \u201cNow that person\u2019s outcome is in (their) hand and (they) have a weighty decision to make.\u201d\nLacey recommends victims report the crime in most cases. Law enforcement will need proof. \nThe police report is \u201csort of your ticket to show to banks and credit reporting agencies\u201d said Betz-Hamilton. It also helps convince banks and creditors that you aren\u2019t complicit in the fraud, said Marchini. \nConsider seeking other help, such as through a victim\u2019s support group like Identity Theft Resource Center or professional therapy.
