The Georgia Tech professor flew to the caves of Borneo to study ancient and current climate conditions. She jetted to a remote South Pacific island to see the effects of warming on coral.\nAdd to that flights to Paris, Rome, Vancouver and elsewhere. All told, in the last three years, she\u2019s flown 29 times to study, meet or talk about global warming.\nThen Cobb thought about how much her personal actions were contributing to the climate crisis, so she created a spreadsheet. She found that those flights added more than 73,000 pounds of heat-trapping carbon to the air.\nNow she is about to ground herself, and she is not alone. Some climate scientists and activists are limiting their flying, their consumption of meat and their overall carbon footprints to avoid adding to the global warming they study.         Cobb will fly just once next year, to attend a massive international science meeting in Chile.\n\u201cPeople want to be part of the solution,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially when they spent their whole lives with their noses stuck up against\u201d data showing the problem.\nThe issue divides climate scientists and activists and plays out on social media. Texas Tech\u2019s         Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist who flies once a month, often to talk to climate doubters in the evangelical Christian movement, was blasted on Twitter because she keeps flying.\nHayhoe and other still-flying scientists note that aviation is only 3% of global carbon emissions.\nJonathan Foley, executive director of the climate solutions think-tank         Project Drawdown, limits his airline trips but will not stop flying because, he says, he must meet with donors to keep his organization alive. He calls flight shaming \u201cthe climate movement eating its own.\u201d\nOver the next couple of weeks, climate scientists and environmental advocates will fly across the globe. Some will be jetting to Madrid for United Nations climate negotiations. Others, including Cobb, will fly to San Francisco for a major earth sciences conference, her last for a while.\n\u201cI feel real torn about that,\u201d said Indiana University\u2019s Shahzeen Attari, who studies human behavior and climate change. She calls Cobb an important climate communicator. \u201cI don\u2019t want to clip her wings.\u201d\nBut Cobb and Hayhoe are judged by their audiences on how much energy they use themselves, Attari said.\nAttari\u2019s research shows that audiences are turned off by scientists who use lots of energy at home. Listeners are more likely to respond to experts who use less electricity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having an overweight doctor giving you dieting advice,\u201d Attari said. She found that scientists who fly to give talks bother people less.\nIn science, flying is \u201cdeeply embedded in how we do academic work,\u201d said Steven Allen, a management researcher at the University of Sheffield, who recently organized a symposium aimed at         reducing flying in academia. He said the conference went well, with 60 people participating remotely from 12 countries.\nPennsylvania State University\u2019s         Michael Mann, who flies but less than he used to, said moderation is key.\n\u201cI don\u2019t tell people they need to become childless, off-the-grid hermits. And I\u2019m not one myself,\u201d Mann said in an email. \u201cI do tell people that individual action is PART of the solution, and that there are many things we can do in our everyday lives that save us money, make us healthier, make us feel better about ourselves AND decrease our environmental footprint. Why wouldn\u2019t we do those things?\u201d\nMann said he gets his electricity from renewables, drives a hybrid vehicle, doesn\u2019t eat meat and has one child.\nWhen Hayhoe flies, she makes sure to bundle in several lectures and visits into one flight, including 30 talks in Alaska in one five-day trip. She said more people come out to see a lecture than if it were given remotely, and she also learns from talking to the people at lectures.\n\u201cThey need a catalyst to get to the next step and me coming could be that catalyst,\u201d Hayhoe said.\nMarshall Shepherd of the University of Georgia will receive a climate communications award at the American Geophysical Union conference Wednesday in San Francisco. But he won\u2019t pick it up in person, saving 1.2 tons of carbon by not flying. He said he doesn\u2019t judge those who fly but wrote about his decision to stay grounded in hopes that people \u201cthink about choices and all of the nuances involved in these decisions.\u201d\nFormer Vice President Al Gore, who has long been criticized by those who reject climate science for his personal energy use, said he has installed 1,000 solar panels at his farm, eats a vegan diet and drives an electric vehicle.\n\u201cAs important as it to change lightbulbs,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cit is far more important to change the policies and laws in the nation and places where we live.\u201d\nTeen activist Greta Thunberg drew attention when she took a zero-carbon sailboat across the Atlantic instead of flying.\n\u201cI\u2019m not telling anyone else what to do or what not to do,\u201d Thunberg told The Associated Press before her return boat trip. \u201cI want to put focus on the fact that you basically can\u2019t live sustainable today. It\u2019s practically impossible.\u201d\nCobb is trying. In 2017, she started biking to work instead of driving. She\u2019s installed solar panels, dries clothes on a line, composts and gave up meat. All these made her feel better, physically and mentally, and gave her more hope that people can do enough to curb the worst of climate change.\nBut when she did the math, she found \u201call of this stuff is very small compared to flying.\u201d\nCobb began turning down flights and offering to talk remotely. This year she passed on 11 flights, including Paris, Beijing and Sydney.\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a single step I have taken that has not brought me a deeper appreciation for what we\u2019re up against and what\u2019s possible,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cThis gave me a profound appreciation for how individual action connects to collective action.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s a cost.\nCobb was invited to be the plenary speaker wrapping up a major ocean sciences conference next year in San Diego. It\u2019s a plum role. Cobb asked organizers if she could do it remotely. They said no. She promised to do many roles for the conference from Atlanta. Conference organizers withdrew the offer.\nBrooks Hanson, executive vice president of the American Geophysical Union, which runs the conference, said in an email that the group supports remote presentations whenever possible. But the wrap-up speaker position \u201crequires in-person interactions with attendees to get the vibe of the meeting and discussions,\u201d Hanson said.\nFoley said that shows the problem: \u201cClimate scientists and activists should walk the walk. But we can only walk so far. Then you bump into other things.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press writer Ben Finley in Hampton, Va., contributed to this report.
