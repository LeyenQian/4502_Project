That followed a 1.5% increase in September. \nIn year-on-year terms, exports were up 1.9%, led by a 4.6% rise in demand from countries outside the European Union. Exports to other EU nations rose only 0.1%.\nGerman imports were flat compared with September and down 0.6% on the year.\nThe unexpectedly upbeat exports report followed data last week showing that factory orders and industrial production both declined in October. Germany only narrowly avoided entering a recession in the third quarter."}
