His brash remarks could amount to either a short-term negotiating gambit or a sign of his willingness to run for re-election without a breakthrough in the trade war. At midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nearly 400 points.\nLater Trump dismissed the tumult on Wall Street, choosing instead to highlight how much stock prices have risen since the start of the year.\n\u201cWe have picked up record numbers in our stock markets, so that\u2019s OK. That\u2019s the way I feel.\u201d Trump replied to questions from reporters. \u201cI have to make the right deal. I\u2019m not going to make a deal that\u2019s not going to be great for our country. It can\u2019t be an even deal. If it\u2019s an even deal, it\u2019s no good.\u201d\nThe trade negotiations with China, the president declared, are at a \u201ccritical stage.\u201d\n\u201cBut if the stock market goes up and down, I don\u2019t watch the stock market, I watch jobs,\u201d Trump said, contradicting the numerous tweets he has sent out when stock markets have set new highs.\nTensions between the two nations flared anew last week after Trump signed legislation expressing U.S. support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong.\nOn Dec. 15, additional U.S. tariffs are set to kick in on many Chinese-made items, including smartphones and toys. The Trump administration is already taxing more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports. China has counterpunched by taxing $120 billion in U.S. imports.\nPressure is building on both sides to complete what Trump has called a limited \"Phase 1\" deal before the deadline. Still, Trump could end up postponing the tariffs, as he did in October, to allow more time for negotiations.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nKevin Freking and Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report."}
