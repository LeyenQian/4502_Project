The nation is already bearing the burden of the largest share of OPEC\u2019s production cuts. \nBut some nations such as Iraq have been ignoring the agreement and producing more than their allotted amount. \n\u201cIf people are already not complying to the current agreement, what\u2019s the point to those that are complying cutting more? So the others can go on cheating?\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, executive director of global oil at research group IHS Markit. \u201cI think the Saudi position is they\u2019re willing to cut more if needed, but they want better compliance.\u201d \nBrent crude oil hovered around $61 per barrel Wednesday afternoon. Prices have fluctuated throughout the year, reaching nearly $75 per barrel in April after U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela limited world supply, but lingering trade tensions between the U.S. and China dampened economic expectations, pushing prices back down. \nWest Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, was trading at around $56 Wednesday afternoon, and its price followed a similar trajectory throughout the year. \nAs it stands, OPEC nations have agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day through March 2020, and most analysts expect OPEC nations to extend those production cuts until at least summer. \n\u201cIf they just keep the existing situation, then you get this massive oversupply,\u201d said Jacques Rousseau, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners. \nRousseau believes OPEC nations will cut production by an additional 400,000 barrels per day to keep supply and demand in balance during the first half of next year, with the cuts made mainly by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But substantial cuts may be difficult to achieve with some OPEC members following their own agendas. \n\u201cIraq has exceeded its production target every month this year,\u201d Rousseau said. \u201cGranted, there\u2019s some unrest going on in the country, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll voluntarily reduce.\u201d \nMeanwhile, Russia, which is not part of OPEC but has been following its lead on production limits in recent years, has indicated it wants its oil production re-calculated in a way that\u2019s in line with OPEC nations. That could enable it to produce more oil. \nAnd even if members of the cartel cut production, there\u2019s more oil coming online from non-OPEC nations including the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Norway and Guyana, which will more than make up for any drop in production, according to IHS Markit. \nThe dynamic to watch will be whether Russia and Saudi Arabia will come to an agreement on production levels in the early and middle parts of next year, said Heather Heldman, managing partner at Luminae Group, a geopolitical intelligence firm. \n\u201cIf something goes awry with Saudi production in the next few months, and there\u2019s a fairly good chance something will happen ... Russia\u2019s going to be the first party looking to fill that gap,\u201d Heldman said. \u201cAnd I think the Saudis know that.\u201d"}
