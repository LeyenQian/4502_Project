The Knot and Brides will no longer allow content glorifying the history of plantations. And Zola will stop listing plantation venues on its site altogether. \nAll four sites announced the changes this week after receiving letters from Color of Change, which describes itself as the country's largest online racial justice organization with 1.5 million members. The organization also sent a letter to Martha Stewart Weddings, which reached back to the group to start a conversation about the issue. \n\u201cPlantations are not just beautiful or charming places,\u201d said Jade Magnus Ogunnaike, senior campaign director of Color of Change, which objected to such descriptions of plantations in its letters to the companies. \u201cThey are places that were intentionally created to force black people to work, torture them and sexual abuse them.\u201d\nPinterest, which couples often use to share and find inspiration for their weddings, said people will still be able to search for plantation venues but the site now shows an advisory warning that some results might violate its policies. The company also will limit autocomplete and search recommendations for plantations searches. Pinterest said it already did not allow plantation wedding venues to advertise on its site and now will take steps to ensure that such ads do not show up on searches. \n\u201cWeddings should be a symbol of love and unity. Plantations represent none of those things. We are grateful to Color of Change for bringing attention to this disrespectful practice,\" Pinterest said in a statement.\nThe Knot, an online wedding planning platform, said it will prohibit vendors \u201cfrom using language that romanticizes or glorifies a history that includes slavery.\" Similarly, Brides has removed references on its site glorifying plantations, according to a statement from its parent company, Dotdash.\nZola, another wedding planning site, said it would no longer allow former plantations to list on its site altogether. The company initially had responded to Color of Change by saying its complaint did not violate its non-discrimination policy, according to BuzzFeed News, which first reported the story Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, however, Zola said it had \u201cre-evaluated all our venues listed on Zola and determined we will not allow vendors to list who are plantations.\"\nZola CEO Shan-Lyn Ma said the company got in touch with Color of Change on Thursday and was scheduling a conversation with the group. She said the company never promoted plantation wedding venues but now would de-list them. \n\u201cThis is really sensitive and painful issue and we want to be doing the right thing by our couples, our employees and anyone who has any interaction with Zola in any way,\" Ma said. \nOgunnaike said Martha Stewart Weddings reached out to Color of Change on Thursday and expressed interest in starting a dialogue on the issue. Martha Stewart Weddings did not immediately return a request for comment. \n\u201cWe are very happy about how receptive the companies they have been. We look forward to larger changes in the wedding industry and the way plantations are viewed across the country,\u201d Ogunnaike said. \nSome former southern plantations have become popular wedding venues over the years but a backlash has been growing. The actors Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds came under fire for tying the knot in 2012 at Boone Hall Plantation and Gardens in Charleston, South Carolina, which was a setting for the 2004 movie \u201cThe Notebook.\u201d\nThe site, which remains a working farm, includes nine of the original slave cabins that were built during the antebellum period. While some old plantations that are open for tours or events don\u2019t include any mention of slavery or enslaved people in promotional materials, Boone Hall\u2019s website includes a section on black history. \nAn official with Belle Hall did not return an email seeking comment. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAP Writer Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this story.
