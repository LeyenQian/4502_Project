{"Title": "Jury: Elon Musk did not defame British caver in tweet", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/jury-elon-musk-defame-british-caver-tweet-67556425", "Article": "\nElon Musk defeated defamation allegations Friday from a British cave explorer who claimed he was branded a pedophile when the Tesla CEO called him \u201cpedo guy\u201d in an angry tweet.\nVernon Unsworth, who participated in the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped for weeks in a Thailand cave last year, had sought $190 million in damages from a man his lawyer called the \u201cbillionaire bully.\" \nIt took less than an hour for an eight-person jury in Los Angeles federal court to reject Unsworth's claim. \nMusk said the verdict restored his faith in humanity as he left the court with a security detail.\nMusk \u2014 who deleted the tweet and later apologized for it \u2014 had asserted the expression was nothing more than a flippant insult that meant \u201ccreepy old man,\u201d not pedophile.\nUnsworth had provoked the attack by belittling Musk\u2019s contribution to the rescue -- a miniature sub his engineers built that was never used -- as ineffective and nothing more than a \u201cPR stunt.\u201d He further earned the ire of the tech whiz by suggesting Musk stick the sub \u201cwhere it hurts.\u201d\nOn Friday, it was Unsworth who felt the pain.\n\u201cI accept the jury verdict, take it on the chin, and move on,\u201d Unsworth said outside court. \nJury foreman Joshua Jones said the panel decided Unsworth\u2019s lawyers had failed to prove their case. He said they spent too much time trying to appeal to jurors' emotions and not concentrating on the evidence. \n\u201cThe failure probably happened because they didn\u2019t focus on the tweets,\u201d Jones said after the verdict was announced. \u201cI think they tried to get our emotions involved in it.\"\nAttorney Lin Wood suggested the jury should award $190 million, including $150 million as a \u201chard slap on the wrist\u201d to punish Tesla CEO for what he said was akin to dropping an atomic weapon on his client that would create problems for years like a radioactive fallout. \nWood said it was important to challenge Musk's tweet in court even if they didn't win. Unsworth had said the statement would appear true if he didn't sue. \n\"Anybody that knows this man, knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that Elon\u2019s accusations were false,\" Wood said outside court. \u201cThis was not the justice that he deserved under the evidence.\u201d\nWood said the verdict sends a message that people can get away with making accusations.\n\u201cEveryone who hears about this verdict should be very, very concerned about their own reputations,\" he said.\nMusk's lawyer told the jury the tweet did not rise to the level of defamation. Attorney Alex Spiro said Unsworth also failed to show actual damages.\nSpiro left the courthouse only saying that the jury did the right thing. \nSpiro mocked Unsworth's claims that he had been shamed and humiliated and that the tweet effectively sentenced him to a life sentence without parole, noting that there are many people actually serving such a term. \nSpiro noted that Unsworth had been honored by the queen of England and the king of Thailand, had his photo taken next to British Prime Minister Theresa May and been asked to speak at schools and contribute to a children's book, which showed that no one took Musk's insult seriously.\n\u201cPeople accused of pedophilia don't get celebrated by world leaders,\u201d Spiro said. \u201cKings and queens and prime ministers don't stand next to pedophiles.\u201d"}
