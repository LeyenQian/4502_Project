It pledged to improve fuel efficiency by an average of 1.5% per year between 2009 and 2020 - and IATA actually achieved 2.3%, de Juniac said. It\u2019s pledging carbon-neutral growth starting next year. And it\u2019s committed to cut emissions to half of the level in 2005 by 2050.\nWith concerns about the global warming caused by excessive carbon emissions from use of fossil fuels, de Juniac stopped short of recommending that IATA\u2019s members - some 290 airlines - make new efforts together. The U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says aviation is responsible for 2% of global man-made carbon emissions.\nEasyJet, which is not an IATA member, has announced carbon offsets for all its domestic and international flights. IATA members British Airways and Qantas have made similar commitments, de Juniac said.\nHe said airlines individually should decide whether to follow suit.\n\u201cWhat we don't want by any means is to make any commitments that we know in advance we are not able or that we are not comfortable (about), or not realistically ... able to stick to,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not liars ... We are not illusionists.\u201d\nThe comments came at a presentation at which IATA said it projected the global airline industry will reap net profit of $29.3 billion in 2020. That is up from $25.9 billion expected this year, which has been marred by a US-China trade war and other international tensions that have dented economic growth. \nIATA says the industry appears on track toward an 11th straight year of profits by the end of next year."}
