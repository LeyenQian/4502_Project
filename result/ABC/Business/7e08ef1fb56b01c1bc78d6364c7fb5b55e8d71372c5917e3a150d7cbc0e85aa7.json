November\u2019s         robust hiring gain suggests that at least some have found a way to do so.\nWith the unemployment rate now at a half-century low of 3.5%, many economists have also warned that hiring would soon slow simply because there are fewer unemployed workers available.\nThat day may still come, but it didn\u2019t in November. Employers added 266,000 jobs last month, the most since January. Monthly hiring has, in fact, picked up since earlier this year: It averaged 205,000 for the past three months, up from a recent low of 135,000 in July.\nFriday\u2019s jobs report largely squelched         fears of a recession that had taken hold in the summer. Steady job growth has helped reassure consumers that the economy is expanding and that their jobs and incomes remain secure. That should boost spending and growth in the months ahead.\nPresident Donald Trump seized on the strong jobs report as he tries to focus voters' attention on the state of the economy rather than the impeachment inquiry being led by House Democrats. The latest numbers also come as Trump\u2019s trade war with China had prompted companies to cut back on their investments in plants and industrial equipment, slowing growth.\n\u201cWithout the horror show that is the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, the Stock Markets and Economy would be even better, if that is possible, and the Border would be closed to the evil of Drugs, Gangs and all other problems! #2020,\u201d the president tweeted.\nHe returned to the report later Friday, tweeting: JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!\u201d\nEmployers seemed to be shrugging off economic concerns, adding jobs at a solid clip. And other risks to the global economy, such as a disorderly Brexit for the U.K., have faded in the past month. Given all that, the economy could provide a boost for Trump in next year\u2019s election.\nInvestors cheered the report, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 340 points in afternoon trading.\nThe new job numbers were released as companies have been getting more creative about enticing workers as the ranks of the unemployed dwindle. Some are willing to hire people who are less qualified and train them, while others are raising pay to attract more applicants. Still others are offering flexible work schedules or have dropped         some drug-testing requirements.\nThese efforts have lifted the proportion of Americans with jobs and lowered the unemployment rate by much more than many economists thought possible.\n\u201cCompanies have somehow achieved continued success in luring job candidates,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.\nSome recruiters have overhauled their approach to hiring and retention as the competition for workers has tightened. Beth Thress, vice president of human resources at a Cincinnati-based company that owns two senior living centers, said it became harder to retain nursing aides and housekeepers once such retailers as Walmart and Target increased their pay.\nSo Thress went to the board of Maple Knoll Communities, a nonprofit that employs 675 people, and won approval to raise starting pay. She also offered more flexible schedules and set up an emergency fund for employees.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot more competition, you\u2019ve got meet their needs in some form or fashion,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real shift in mentality.\u201d\nThe changes are working so far, Thress said. The company has reduced turnover from about 40% in 2017 to just 8% so far this year.\nWages overall still aren\u2019t growing as quickly as they have in previous expansions, but there are signs of improvement. Average hourly pay for workers, excluding managers and supervisors, which covers about 80% of the workforce, rose 3.7% in November from a year ago. That\u2019s just a tick lower than October\u2019s figure, which was the highest since the recession.\nThe higher pay is coaxing         workers off the sidelines and back into the job market. The proportion of Americans in their prime working years, aged 25 through 54, with a job was 80.3% last month, matching October\u2019s level as the highest since January 2007.\nCompanies are also offering bigger raises to entice potential candidates who are working elsewhere. People who switched jobs saw their pay rise 4.3% from a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the biggest gain since the recession and a full percentage point higher than the pay increase for those who stayed.\nBecky Frankiewicz, president of Manpower Group North America, says her organization often tells its corporate clients to consider loosening their job listing criteria.\n\u201cWe are counseling companies to look at the requirements they set for a job and ask if they are really mandatory or just nice to have,\u201d she said.\nFrankiewicz pointed to the fact that nearly 90% of the technology jobs listed at Manpower require a college degree in computer science, but less than half the people working in the field have one.\nRebecca Hamilton, co-CEO of Badger Balm, a skincare company, said the firm\u2019s generous pay and benefits have made it easy to fill jobs, even though it is based in a small town of 700 near Keene, New Hampshire.\nThe 90-person company offers health and retirement benefits, but also an on-site gym, yoga classes and massages, and a free organic lunch every day.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any trouble whatsoever finding really good, talented people,\u201d Hamilton said.\nStill, it\u2019s not clear how long companies will be able to keep hiring at November\u2019s blowout pace. The fact that wages gains are accelerating suggests that companies aren\u2019t just luring in new workers, but fighting for a smaller pool of applicants.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an indication that we are starting to reach the limits of the job market,\u201d said Joe Song, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch."}
