Despite that, neighboring Muslim countries do not have similar rules. \nRestaurants and cafes in Saudi Arabia, including major Western chains like Starbucks, are currently segregated by \"family\" sections allocated for women who are out on their own or who are accompanied by male relatives, and \u201csingles\u201d sections for just men. Many also have separate entrances for women and partitions or rooms for families where women are not visible to single men. In smaller restaurants or cafes with no space for segregation, women are not allowed in. \nReflecting the sensitive nature of this most recent move, the decision to end requirements of segregation in restaurants was announced in a statement published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency. The statement listed a number of newly-approved technical requirements for buildings, schools, stores and sports centers , among others. \nThe statement noted that the long list of published decisions was aimed at attracting investments and creating greater business opportunities.\nAmong the regulations announced was \u201cremoving a requirement by restaurants to have an entrance for single men and (another) for families.\u201d\nCouched between a new regulation about the length of a building's facade and allowing kitchens on upper floors to operate was another critical announcement stating that restaurants no longer need to \u201cspecify private spaces\u201d\u2014 an apparent reference to partitions.\nAcross Saudi Arabia, the norm has been that unrelated men and women are not permitted to mix in public. Government-run schools and most public universities remain segregated, as are most Saudi weddings. \nIn recent years, however, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has pushed for sweeping social reforms ,with women and men now able to attend concerts and movie theaters that were once banned. He also curtailed the powers of the country's religious police, who had been enforcers of conservative social norms, like gender segregation in public. \nTwo years ago, women for the first time were allowed to attend sports events in stadiums in the so-called \u201cfamily\u201d sections. Young girls in recent years have also been allowed access to physical education and sports in school, a right that only boys had been afforded. \nIn August, the kingdom lifted a controversial ban on travel by allowing all citizens \u2014 women and men alike \u2014 to apply for a passport and travel freely, ending a long-standing guardianship policy that had controlled women\u2019s freedom of movement.\nThe new rules remove restrictions that had been in place, but do not state that restaurants or cafes have to end segregated entrances or seated areas. Many families in conservative swaths of the country, where women cover their hair and face in public, may prefer eating only at restaurants with segregated spaces.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates."}
