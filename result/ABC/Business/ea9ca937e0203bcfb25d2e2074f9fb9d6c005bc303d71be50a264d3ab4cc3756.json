Next time \u2026\"\nMusk debuted the company's first all-electric pickup truck at a grand press event at the Tesla Design Center in Hawthorne, California, on Nov. 21, boasting the truck's \"armor glass\" exterior that was supposedly unbreakable and even bulletproof to small arms fire.\nThe CEO then slammed one of the windows with a sledgehammer and didn't even make a dent.\n\nBut then, things took a turn when Musk invited Tesla's chief designer Franz von Holzhausen on stage, asking him, \"Could you try to break this glass please?\"\n\nVon Holzhausen hurled the steel ball at the window and it shattered. He tried again with the rear window and the same thing happened.\n\n\u201cOh my f------ God,\u201d Musk exclaimed onstage. \u201cWell, maybe that was a little too hard.\u201d\nDespite the broken windows, demand for the Cybertruck so far has shattered some expectations.\n\nMusk tweeted Sunday night that the vehicle already has 200,000 preorders, even though it won't hit the road until late 2021.\n"}
