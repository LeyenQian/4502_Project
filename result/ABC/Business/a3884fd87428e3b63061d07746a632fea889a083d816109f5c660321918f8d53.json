Opinion polls suggest the Conservatives have a lead over Labour. But all the parties are nervous about the verdict of a volatile electorate fed up after years of Brexit wrangling.\nAt a fish market in the eastern England port of Grimsby, seafood company owner Nathan Godley summed up the hopes of many that \u2014 one way or another \u2014 the election would provide a pathway to a resolution of Brexit. \n\u201cI think we all got a bit weary of the politicians over the last few years really, and I think having a government with a majority to give them the clout to actually do what they want is a good thing,\u201d he said. \nJohnson voted near the prime minister's Downing Street residence in London, accompanied by his dog, Dilyn. Corbyn was greeted by supporters and an activist dressed as Elmo from \u201cSesame Street\u201das he arrived to vote in his north London constituency.\nThe two parties are offering voters starkly different visions of the future. Johnson campaigned relentlessly on a promise to \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d \u2014 and promised a modest increase in public spending \u2014 while Labour vowed to tax the rich, nationalize industries such as railroads and water companies and give everyone in the country free internet access. \nOn Brexit, Labour says it will negotiate a new divorce deal with the EU and then offer voters the choice of leaving the 28-nation bloc on those terms or remaining.\nThe prime minister pushed for this early election to try to break a logjam in Parliament that stalled approval of his Brexit agreement. He says if he wins a majority, he will get Parliament to ratify his \u201coven-ready\u201d divorce deal with the EU and take Britain out of the bloc as scheduled on Jan. 31.\nRecent surveys suggest the Conservatives' lead may have narrowed in the final days of campaigning. While Labour is unlikely to get an outright majority, smaller pro-EU opposition parties hope to win enough seats so they can team up to block Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans.\nThe Conservatives have focused much energy on trying to win in a \u201cred wall\u201d of working-class towns in central and northern England that have elected Labour lawmakers for decades but also voted strongly in 2016 to leave the EU. Polls suggest the plan may be working. The Conservatives also have been helped by the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage, which decided at the last minute not to contest 317 Conservative-held seats to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote.\nLabour, which is largely but ambiguously pro-EU, faces competition for anti-Brexit voters from the centrist Liberal Democrats, the Scottish and Welsh nationalist parties, and the Greens.\nLabour has tried to focus the campaign on the plight of the National Health Service, a deeply respected institution that has struggled to meet rising demand after nine years of austerity under Conservative-led governments.\nOne of the campaign's defining images was a photo of a sick 4-year-old boy sleeping on a hospital floor because no beds were available. Johnson's initial failure to even look at the photo put him on the defensive, portraying him as insensitive to the child's plight. \nThe photo, initially published by the Yorkshire Evening Post, swept across social media like a firestorm in the final days of the campaign.\nFor many voters, the election offers an unpalatable choice. Both Johnson and Corbyn have personal approval ratings in negative territory, and both have been dogged by questions about their character.\nJohnson has been confronted by his past broken promises, lies and offensive statements, from calling the children of single mothers \u201cignorant, aggressive and illegitimate\u201d to comparing Muslim women who wear face-covering veils to \"letter boxes.\"\nIn Uxbridge, the suburban London seat that Johnson represents in Parliament, Stefan Hay said he was voting for the prime minister despite his flaws.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, whether you like him or not, with all of his eccentricities, I think he has leadership ability and I think he is the best man for the job, simple as that,\" Hay said. \nCorbyn has been accused of allowing anti-Semitism to spread within the party. The 70-year-old left-winger is portrayed by opponents as an aging Marxist with unsavory past associations with Hamas and the IRA.\nBut many voters said they were backing Labour because of its stance on social issues.\n\u201cIf the Tories win, this country will just fall apart,\u201d said Eleanor Sawbridge Burton, a freelance writer in London. \u201cIt will really hit climate change and the NHS. It feels a bit hopeless.\u201d\nWith so much at stake, political parties have pushed the boundaries of truth, transparency and reality during five weeks of campaigning. \nSocial media platforms were a critical battleground, as the parties bombarded voters with messages \u2014 many of them misleading.\nThe Conservatives, in particular, were criticized for using underhanded tactics on social media. The party circulated a doctored video that made it look as if an opposition leader had been stumped when asked about his position on Brexit. Then during a TV debate, the party re-branded its press office Twitter account as a fact-checking service. \nLabour also sought to co-opt the role of independent fact-checker, rolling out a website called The Insider, which urged voters to \u201ctrust the facts.\u201d\nRasmus Kleis Nielsen, director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford, said the digital campaign showed that the political landscape had changed.\n\u201cYou don't get more establishment than the British Conservative Party,\" Nielsen said. \u201cIf that is what they see as fit and proper, we must confront the fact that this is the new normal.''\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press writers Sheila Norman-Culp and Jo Kearney in London contributed.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at          https://www.apnews.com/Brexit     "}
