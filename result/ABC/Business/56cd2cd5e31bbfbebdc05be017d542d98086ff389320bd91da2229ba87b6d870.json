Currently, the 28-nation bloc aims for a reduction of 40% by 2030, and some leaders have called for this target to be raised to 55%, with a long-term goal of ending virtually all new emissions by 2050.\nThe report was released as officials from almost 200 countries meet in Madrid for U.N. climate talks. The EU\u2019s new executive Commission is expected to present its long-term plan for tackling global warming \u2014 dubbed the European Green Deal \u2014 next week.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow AP's climate coverage at https://www.apnews.com/Climate\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
