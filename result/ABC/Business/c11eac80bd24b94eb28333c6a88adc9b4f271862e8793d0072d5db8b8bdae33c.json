But it's unclear whether the transparency will help rebuild trust or backfire by showing customers how deep Uber's safety problems go.\nIn the safety report, Uber said 464 people were raped while using its services in 2017 and 2018. Almost all of them \u2014 92% \u2014 were riders. It's difficult to compare those statistics to other modes of transportation, because U.S. taxi companies and transit agencies generally do not collect similar national data.\nEven so, many said the report shows Uber has work to do.\n\u201cThis is a major crisis situation that they're going to have to deal with because the brand's built on safety, and even though some could try to say it's a small number, it's still way too high \u2014 it's higher than zero \u2014 and I think that shows a gap in their screening process,\u201d said Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities. The revelations give \u201cmeat on the bones\u201d to regulators, including those in London who chose not to renew Uber's license over safety issues, he said.\nUber has been working to improve safety over the last two years, rolling out features including an in-app emergency button, a ride-check feature that detects unexpected stops or crashes and the ability for riders or drivers to share their location with loved ones during a ride. The company outlined additional safety steps it will take in the report.\nOn Monday, Uber plans to launch in seven cities a feature to give riders a four-digit number that they can use to verify that they are getting into the right car. Next year, it plans to launch a survivor support hotline staffed by RAINN, a sexual violence organization, and to provide sexual misconduct education for drivers. The hotline may encourage more victims to report attacks.\nThe report only covers Uber's U.S. operations. The U.S. and Canada brought in 63% of Uber's revenue last quarter. Lyft said it would release its own safety report, but it has not indicated when.\nCritics say Uber should be doing more, particularly with background checks, to weed out potentially dangerous drivers. Unlike many taxi companies, Uber and its main U.S. rival, Lyft, do not check drivers' fingerprints against a national database.\nThe gold standard for background checks is fingerprinting \u201cbecause someone can easily fake a Social Security number,\" said Dominique Penson, an attorney who has represented sexual assault victims. \u201cYou can't fake a fingerprint. And if somebody has been convicted of a crime anywhere in the United States, that will appear in a national database, and when you run that fingerprint, you'll know.\"\nUber says the FBI has acknowledged its database is incomplete and does not always include a final disposition. The company's process includes a motor vehicle screening, a criminal background check and ongoing notifications about any new offenses.\nAn added fingerprint check could add precious time to the driver-approval process at a time when both Uber and Lyft are fiercely competing for market share. \nDashboard cameras also could help by recording incidents and serving as a deterrent for bad behavior, said Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy, a blog and online community for drivers. Campbell encourages drivers to get cameras, but the ride-hailing companies have not encouraged the practice.\n\u201cEven if you have dashcam footage, it's hard to get Uber and Lyft to actually look at the footage,\" Campbell said.\nLast month, Uber announced it would allow passengers and drivers in Brazil and Mexico to record audio of their rides.\nA U.S. House committee is looking at legislation that could reduce the number of sex assaults involving ride-hailing passengers and drivers, U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said Friday.\nThe committee has discussed requiring fingerprint background checks, camera monitoring and front license plates for ride-hailing cars in states that don\u2019t have them. This would help prevent fake ride-hailing drivers from picking up passengers by making it easier for passengers to check plate numbers against the ones provided by Uber and Lyft, DeFazio said.\nIn Eugene, Oregon, fingerprint checks earlier this year by the local police department found about two dozen Uber and Lyft drivers had criminal records that were missed in the companies\u2019 checks, DeFazio said. One was a convicted murderer, while another was a registered sex offender, according to The Register-Guard newspaper. The city stopped the people from driving for the companies.\nThere may be limits on what federal legislators can do. Ride-hailing companies could be regulated federally because they conduct interstate commerce, but that is new legal territory, he said.\nStill, he applauded Uber\u2019s report, saying the company had done more than any of its competitors \u201cby just reporting,\" DeFazio said. \u201cThere\u2019s more to be done, for sure.\u201d\nThe report raised alarm among some riders.\n\u201cI think I've taken it a little bit for granted, the fact that the app already tracks who I am and where I'm at,\" said Mary Yao, 28, an MBA student at U.C. Berkeley. \u201cI think I'll be more conscientious next time I climb into a car to not always be on my phone. So it has made me raise my awareness a little bit.\u201d\nBryant Greening, an attorney and co-founder of LegalRideshare, a Chicago law firm that specializes in ride-sharing cases, noted that more than 40% percent of the reported sexual assaults, which include incidents less serious than rape, were against drivers, who also are at risk.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more dangerous place to be than in a moving car with a stranger,\u201d Greening said. \u201cYou are really vulnerable without a clear path to escape. So this system, rideshare, needs to be made safe for everybody who is in that car.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nKrisher reported from Detroit.
