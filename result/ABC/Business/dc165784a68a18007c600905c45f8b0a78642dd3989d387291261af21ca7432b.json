On top of that, his administration proposed to target $2.4 billion in French imports in a retaliatory move over France\u2019s new digital tax. The Trump administration says France\u2019s tax unfairly targets American tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook.\nTrump\u2019s mercurial statements and actions on trade have rattled investors this week. In late morning trading Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 400 points.\nDan Digre has long since stopped expecting much from U.S. negotiations with China. He\u2019s heard it all before.\nDigre\u2019s 70-year-old family firm, Misco Speakers in St. Paul, Minnesota, is caught in the crossfire of the U.S.-China conflict. Misco is absorbing Trump\u2019s tariffs on the parts it buys from China for the specialized speakers it makes for the aircraft and medical device industries, among others.\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that something will happen, but I\u2019m not optimistic,\u2019\u2019 Digre said. \u201cThere have been so many false deals: A deal is close, a deal is close \u2014 then nothing.\u2019\u2019\nBoth sides may have an incentive to reach a deal before Dec. 15. That\u2019s when the Trump administration is set to start taxing an additional $160 billion of Chinese imports. These tariffs would hit many Chinese-made goods that are on holiday shopping lists \u2014 smartphones and toys, for example \u2014 and would extend Trump\u2019s tariffs to just about everything China ships to the United States.\nA former Trump administration official who has been briefed on the talks and requested anonymity to speak frankly said the U.S. is considering delaying the Dec. 15 tariffs if the talks go well \u2014 but keeping the option to restore the tariffs if no progress is made toward a more comprehensive agreement.\nThe signs have been mixed.\nLast week, Trump said \u201cWe\u2019re in the final throes of a very important deal.\u201d And China\u2019s Commerce Ministry reported that its negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, had spoken by phone with his U.S. counterparts, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The official Xinhua News Agency said the men had discussed their \u201ccore concerns\u2019\u2019 and \u201cagreed to maintain communication on remaining issues in consultations on the Phase 1 deal.\u201d\nEarlier, China had made goodwill gestures, issuing improved guidelines for protection of patents, copyrights and other intellectual property and lifting a five-year ban on American poultry.\nThen Trump\u2019s comments Tuesday seemed to suggest that a breakthrough might not come anytime soon.\nIt\u2019s been a year and a half since Trump declared that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u2019\u2019 But his war with China has dragged on and on, with each side imposing \u2014 and raising \u2014 import taxes on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods. Those taxes are paid by companies that import those goods. These importers must either absorb those higher costs or pass them on to customers in the form of price increases.\nNegotiators have met 13 times. Truces have come and gone. Predictions of peace have proved premature.\nFor now, at least, the reality remains: The United States is taxing more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports, and Beijing is retaliating with tariffs on $120 billion of American products. Not since the 1930s has the world seen such intense trade warfare.\nThe two sides are fighting over allegations that China has deployed predatory tactics in its drive to achieve global dominance in such advanced technologies as quantum computing and electric cars. The administration asserts, and many China analysts agree, that these tactics include stealing sensitive technology, unfairly subsidizing their own firms and forcing foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to China\u2019s market.\nOn Oct. 11, Trump had announced what he cast as a breakthrough: Beijing had agreed to buy far more U.S. farm products \u2014 as much as $50 billion worth annually, the administration said \u2014 and to better protect intellectual property. In return, the United States suspended plans to raise tariffs on $112 billion in Chinese goods.\nEven though this so-called Phase 1 deal left the thorniest issues for future negotiations, the two sides still haven\u2019t managed to finalize it.\n\u201cIt now looks likely that a Phase 1 deal will be rather limited in scope, hardly resolving the broader trade-related uncertainty that continues to cloud business sentiment in both countries,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist who formerly led the China division at the International Monetary Fund.\nBeijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy the Trump administration. Doing so would likely require scaling back China's aspirations for technological supremacy, which it sees as crucial to its prosperity.\nThe prolonged trade war has been inflicting economic damage. Factories have cut purchases and investments because they don't know whether or when Trump will lift his tariffs or which countries he might target next.\nThe president\u2019s sudden move Monday to take action against Argentina and Brazil underscored how unpredictable his policies are. Last year, he had agreed to exempt the two countries from tariffs on steel and aluminum. But he reversed that decision in a tweet Monday morning, accusing Argentina and Brazil of manipulating their currencies lower to give their exporters a price advantage. In fact, their currencies are plunging because their economies are in crisis.\nOn Tuesday, the Trump administration ratcheted up tensions with Europe by announcing plans to impose tariffs of up to 100% on cheese, Champagne and lipstick and other imports from France to protest a French digital services tax.\nThe administration is also readying taxes on $7.5 billion worth of European Union imports in a dispute over illegal EU subsidies to aircraft manufacturer Airbus.\nThe tariffs and the uncertainty they generate have hurt the U.S. manufacturing sector, which many economists say is already in recession. On Monday, a private survey found that American factory output had fallen for the fourth straight month.\nAt Misco Speakers, CEO Digre is postponing investments, trying to negotiate discounts with suppliers and hoping he won\u2019t be forced to reduce his 100-person workforce. He\u2019s planning a trip to the Philippines to find a supplier that isn\u2019t subject to Trump\u2019s China tariffs.\n\u201cThe damage it does to a business is multiple,\u2019\u2019 Digre said. The tariffs are \u201ca drain on your cashflow,\u201d and \u201crather than spending the time developing new things, you\u2019re trying to find someone else to make the same thing.\u2019\u2019\nAnd then, he said, there\u2019s \u201cthe uncertainty of: What\u2019s going to happen next? Is it going to go on another year? Is it going to go on another five years?\u2019\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report."}
