It cleared Japan\u2019s upper house Wednesday after clearing the more powerful lower house earlier.\nSome critics say the deal is more advantageous to the U.S. since a 2.5% tariff on Japanese automobiles remains.\nThe deal will pave the way for cheaper American beef and other agricultural products in Japan.\nTrump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, negotiated by the Obama administration.\nU.S. farmers have felt they were at a disadvantage compared to Australian or Canadian counterparts.\nJapan also reached a separate trade deal with Europe.\nJapan, which imports U.S. farm products worth $14 billion, is America\u2019s third-largest market.\nThe U.S. and Japan have agreed to continue talks on trade, and the auto tariffs are likely to come up in the talks.\nThe Japanese auto industry is a key part of this nation\u2019s economy, although the manufacturers, such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., have moved production abroad to avert tariffs and become part of American business.\nWhen the trade deal was reached in September, Trump said it means opening Japan\u2019s market to about $7 billion in U.S. farm goods, with tariffs lowered or scrapped on American beef, pork, wheat, cheese, corn and wine.\nAbe has called the deal a \u201cwin-win,\u201d prompting criticism from the opposition. Japanese farmers form a large support base for Abe\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Japan has long had protectionist policies on agricultural imports, especially rice.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at         https://twitter.com/yurikageyama     \nOn Instagram         https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en     "}
