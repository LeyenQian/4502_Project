He set Monday for the one-day meetings with parliamentary groups. But protesters have already began rallying against the potential candidate for the job, saying he is too close to the political elite they have been calling on to step down.\nIn a stark reflection of the deepening economic crisis, a man in his 40s shot himself to death Wednesday with a bird rifle when he became despondent over salary cuts in recent weeks, according to his family.\nThe father of 41-year-old Danny Abi Haidar said his son, who worked in a lighting company, spent the day Tuesday warding off creditors, trying to explain that he only received half his salary because of the economic crisis. Many private companies have resorted to reducing staff or slashing their pay to deal with rising inflation and liquidity crunch.\nAdding to the burden, the son had been supporting his father, his mother and younger brother. The father had lost his job eight months ago and moved in with his older son.\nOn Tuesday, the local supermarket began demanding hundreds of dollars that Abi Haidar, a father of three, owed them.\nCreditors \u201ccalled him and he said I only got paid half my salary,\u201d the father, Mohammed Abi Haidar, told The Associated Press. \u201cHe said I only have 200,000 liras (barely $100) to spend on my family.\u201d\nThe father, distraught, said he holds senior officials and the protests responsible for his son\u2019s death.\n\u201cI hold those senior officials responsible; the revolution and everyone, I hold them responsible,\u201d Abi Haidar said.\nProtesters, already mobilized against the name floated as a potential successor for resigned Prime Minister Saad Hariri, gathered in central Beirut on Wednesday to mourn Abi Haidar\u2019s death.\n\u201cHow many more suicides do you want?\u201d read one placard raised by a protester. Marwa Saad, a protester who was among hundreds at a rally that blocked a major Beirut intersection, said government officials are wasting time and fail to sense the depth of the public misery.\n\u201cThey are blind and deaf while we burn and kill ourselves. They still don\u2019t feel a thing,\u201d she said, raising a Lebanese flag. The protesters light candles along the road they blocked. Security forces deployed but didn\u2019t forcefully open the road.\nThe protesters say Samir Khatib, named as a possible prime minister and a prominent contractor, is close to the political elite they have been protesting since Oct. 17.\nHundreds of protesters blocked in towns in the Bekaa valley in the east on Wednesday in rallies against Khatib. Lebanon\u2019s armed forces said it arrested 16 protesters following scuffles to break up road blocks.\nTo alleviate the pressure on the banks amid a liquidity crunch and rising risk of defaulting, Lebanon\u2019s central bank said it has put a ceiling on interest rates, slashing them on dollar deposits and loans to 5% from as high as 14%.\nThe central bank\u2019s decision applies to new deposits and ones renewed after Wednesday. Interest rates on Lebanese pound-denominated deposits would be set at 8.5%.\nDepositors have rushed to withdraw their money after banks reopened following a two-week shut-down at the start of the protests.\nLebanese officials estimate that as much as $4 billion have been withdrawn from banks over the past weeks as the local currency loses nearly 40% of its value. The money remains in the country but reflects the deepening confidence crisis banks are facing.\nLocal banks also imposed capital control measures unseen before in the country known for its free-market economy, such as limiting withdrawals and transfers of money abroad.\nThe central bank\u2019s decisions buy time until a new government is formed. International donors had pledged $11 billion to Lebanon\u2019s troubled economy in 2018, long before the protests began. But the donors had called for major economic changes to release the loans and grants.\nHariri resigned Oct. 29 amid nationwide protests, saying he reached a \u201cdead end\u201d with his political rivals over an emergency government. The protesters have been calling for a technocrat government, accusing the current political elite of widespread corruption and mismanagement of the country\u2019s economy. Hariri has expressed support for Khatib as a potential successor."}
