Guests included former Federal Aviation Administration chief Randy Babbitt. The participants heard from CEO Dennis Muilenburg, other Boeing executives and test pilots.\nBoeing hopes to enlist pilots and flight attendants in its effort to convince the public that the plane will be safe after changes are made to flight-control software that was implicated in the crashes. \n\u201cI have had a few (flight attendants) come up to me and say, 'Please don't make me get on that plane,'\u201d Bassani said. She isn't sure how widespread that fear is \u2014 the union has not surveyed its members.\nTwo other unions that represent flight attendants at other carriers also attended the event. Pilot unions were not invited, although they have attended previous Boeing meetings on the Max and taken turns in a flight simulator.\nAirlines can't fly their Max jets \u2014 even without passengers \u2014 without special permission from the FAA, but they are taking some steps to prepare the planes for service. \nAmerican Airlines has 16 Max jets in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and eight in Roswell, New Mexico. Crews run the engines every few days and taxi the planes on the ground, but don't take them up in the air.\nAmerican, Southwest and United have removed the Max from their schedules into early March. \nLast month, Boeing came up with a checklist before the Max can fly. It is currently performing tests with airline pilots to measure their response to emergencies this week. Among the remaining items are a certification flight with the FAA, and FAA approval of updated pilot training for the Max. "}
