South Korea\u2019s Kospi inched up nearly 0.1% to 2,070.44. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was up 0.6% at 26,228.38, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.7% to 2,897.99.\nShares on Wall Street finished higher, with the gains snapped a three-day losing streak for the S&P 500. The U.S. market has swung sharply for months on every hint of progress about talks between the world\u2019s largest economies, and Asian regional indexes have tended to reflect those fluctuations.\nIn the latest development, Bloomberg News reported that U.S. negotiators expect a \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade agreement to be completed before U.S. tariffs are set to rise on Chinese products Dec. 15.\nThe report came a day after Trump said he wouldn\u2019t mind waiting until after the 2020 elections for a deal, a remark that officials reportedly called off the cuff but nevertheless sent markets skidding.\n\u201cThe trade war will be the key driver of sentiment in the immediate few weeks,\u201d DBS Group analysts wrote in a report.\nThe S&P 500 rose 19.56 points, or 0.6%, to 3,112.76. Despite recovering some losses, the index is still down 0.9% for the week.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 146.97 points, or 0.5%, to 27,649.78. The Nasdaq composite gained 46.03 points, or 0.5%, to 8,566.67. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 11.27 points, or 0.7%, to 1,613.90.\nENERGY:\nBenchmark U.S. crude lost 21 cents to $58.22 a barrel. It climbed $2.33, or 4.2%, to $58.43 per barrel Wednesday, as members of OPEC prepare to meet later this week and vote on production levels. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 7 cents to $62.93.\nCURRENCIES:\nThe dollar rose to 108.91 Japanese yen from 108.68 yen Wednesday. The euro weakened slightly to $1.1084 from $1.1088.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAP Business Writers Alex Veiga and Stan Choe contributed."}
