Now some are sprinting down vehicle lanes or renting cars to try to make it inside the U.S.\nThe migrants\u2019 efforts are causing traffic delays at Arizona crossings because U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials had to barricade lanes used by cars legally entering the U.S. from Mexico, officials said.\nAdvocates say many have become desperate after waiting for months to legally ask for asylum, often in poor conditions and while facing threats of kidnapping, extortion and violence south of the border.\nShoppers, teachers and visitors traveling to the U.S. through Nogales, Mexico, endured up to five-hour waits Monday and over the weekend, causing concerns among local officials whose tax base relies on Mexican shoppers, especially during the holiday season.\nIn a statement, Customs and Border Protection said it\u2019s committed to the safety of border crossers, adding that there\u2019s been an increase of incursions through vehicle lanes \u201cby asylum seekers attempting to evade established entry processes.\u201d\n\u201cThese tactics interfere with CBP officers conducting their responsibilities and exacerbates wait times for daily commuters,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cCBP will not allow ports to be overrun, or unauthorized entry.\u201d\nThe traffic jams could hurt sales at stores in Nogales, Arizona that depend on Mexican shoppers during the holiday season, said Mayor Arturo Garino.\nGarino, a part-time teacher, said some students and teachers who live in Mexico but attend and work at schools across the border in the U.S. have been leaving their homes as early as 5 a.m. to arrive on time.\nGarino said Mexican authorities were not doing enough to stem the problem. The Arizona Daily Star reported the Nogales, Sonora, police officers were checking cars headed north to the border on Monday afternoon.\nThe metal barricades are large and are meant to seal off traffic lanes.\nAbout 3,000 migrants are living in Nogales, Mexico as they wait their turns to seek asylum, said Katie Sharar, communications director for the Kino Border Initiative, a religious-based group that provides meals to needy migrants on the Mexican side of the border.\nUnder a policy by the Trump administration known widely as \u201cmetering,\u201d the asylum-seekers must wait in an unofficial line in Mexico until U.S. authorities call them up in a process that usually lasts several months.\nAnother policy, colloquially known as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d requires asylum seekers to return to Mexico after they have made credible fear claims to justify their asylum requests and wait there while their immigration cases are pending.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s just a lot of desperation and uncertainty. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to them, they don\u2019t know how the policy changes are gonna affect them,\u201d Sharar said.\nSharar said she wasn\u2019t familiar with the migrants who have run through vehicle lanes.\nCustoms and Border Protection did not respond to email and phone messages regarding questions about the migrants who rushed the border, what countries they come from and whether they were detained or faced criminal charges.\nArizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, said his first concern is public safety and that he is confident U.S. officials will resolve the border traffic problems.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press writer Bob Christie in Phoenix contributed to this report."}
