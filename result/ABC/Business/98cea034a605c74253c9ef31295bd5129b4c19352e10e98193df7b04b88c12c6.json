They want it, and so do we!\"'\nEarlier Thursday, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, Gao Feng, had told reporters that \u201cthe economic and trade teams of both sides have maintained close communication.\u201d He offered no additional details to release.\nBeijing had threatened to retaliate if Trump proceeded with plans to raise tariffs on $160 billion of Chinese imports Sunday.\nThe two sides are negotiating a so-called Phase 1 agreement as part of the effort to resolve their sprawling trade dispute.\nStill, the truce leaves unsettled the toughest and most complex issues that have divided the two sides.\nThe administration accuses Beijing of cheating in its drive to achieve global supremacy in such advanced technologies as driver-less cars and artificial intelligence. The administration alleges \u2014 and independent analysts generally agree \u2014 that China steals technology, forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets, unfairly subsidizes its own firms and throws up bureaucratic hurdles for foreign rivals.\nBeijing rejects the accusations and contends that Washington is simply trying to suppress a rising competitor in international trade.\nSince July 2018, the Trump administration has imposed import taxes on $360 billion in Chinese products. Beijing has retaliated by taxing $120 billion in U.S. exports, including soybeans and other farm products that are vital to many of Trump's supporters in rural America.\nOn Sunday, the U.S. is scheduled to start taxing another $160 billion in Chinese imports, a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the United States.\nRepeated rounds of negotiations had failed to achieve even a preliminary agreement. The prolonged uncertainty over Trump's trade policies has slowed U.S. business investment and likely held back economic growth. Many corporations have slowed or suspended investment plans until they know when, how or even whether the trade standoff will end.\nA far-reaching agreement on China's technology policies will likely prove difficult. It would require Beijing to scale back its drive to become a global powerhouse in industrial high technology, something it sees as a path to prosperity and international influence.\nEfforts to acquire foreign technology are a theme that runs through Chinese law and government. Security researchers have asserted that Beijing operates a network of research institutes and business parks to turn stolen foreign technology into commercial products.\nThe Trump administration has been seeking a way to enforce any significant trade agreement with China, reflecting its contention that Beijing has violated past promises. One way to do is to retain some tariffs as leverage. "}
