He said France shouldn\u2019t be singled out for wanting to correct that imbalance with a tax on tech firms.\n\u201cMy first question is what will happen with the United Kingdom, which adopted the same tax? For Italy, the same tax? Austria, Spain ...,\u201d Macron asked. \u201cIf we\u2019re serious, those countries will have to be treated the same way.\u201d\nThe U.S. move is likely to increase trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe. Trump said the European Union should \u201cshape up, otherwise things are going to get very tough.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not in love with those (tech) companies, but they\u2019re our companies,\u201d Trump said ahead of his meeting with Macron.\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the U.S. tariff threat is \u201csimply unacceptable. ... It\u2019s not the behavior we expect from the United States toward one of its main allies.\u201d\nThe French tech tax, he said, is aimed at \u201cestablishing tax justice.\u201d France wants digital companies to pay their fair share of taxes in countries where they make money instead of using tax havens, and is pushing for an international agreement on the issue.\nThe problem is pronounced in Europe, where a foreign company can pay most of its taxes in the one EU country where it has its regional base - often a small country like Luxembourg or Ireland that tries to attract multinationals with very low corporate taxes.\nLe Maire noted that France will reimburse the tax if the U.S. agrees to the international tax plan.\nFrench wine and cheese producers expressed dismay about being caught in the middle of the battle over digital revenues. Cheese producers warned the U.S. measure would hit small businesses hardest.\nAn industry association for pungent Roquefort cheese, among the targeted products, said the 100% tariffs could wipe out the U.S. market - 300 tons a year - for the blue-veined cheese.\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have a product known around the world but the reverse side of that is that every time there\u2019s a trade dispute, Roquefort is systematically targeted,\u201d said Jerome Faramond, the association president.\nLe Maire said France talked this week with the European Commission about EU-wide retaliatory measures if Washington follows through with the tariffs next month.\nEU Commission spokesman Daniel Rosario said the EU will seek \u201cimmediate discussions with the U.S. on how to solve this issue amicably.\u201d\nThe U.S tariffs could double the price American consumers pay for French imports and would come on top of a 25% tax on French wine imposed last month over a separate dispute over subsidies to Airbus and Boeing.\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative charges that France\u2019s new digital services tax discriminates against U.S. companies.\nFrance disputes that, saying it targets European and Chinese businesses, too. The tax imposes a 3% annual levy on French revenues of any digital company with yearly global sales worth more than 750 million euros ($830 million) and French revenue exceeding 25 million euros.\nThe U.S. investigated the French tax under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 \u2014 the same provision the Trump administration used last year to probe China's technology policies, leading to tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports in the biggest trade war since the 1930s.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAamer Madhani and Zeke Miller in London, Darlene Superville and Paul Wiseman in Washington and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report."}
