Traders were also encouraged by a Wall Street Journal report saying Washington has offered to slash existing tariffs and cancel new ones set to kick in on Sunday in exchange for more agricultural purchases and intellectual property protection.\n\u201cIf we do see the tariffs removed, that's saying, \u2018OK, China must be agreeing to things or we must be right there,'\u201d said Ben Phillips, chief investment officer at EventShares. \u201cThat\u2019s why the market is looking at tariffs as the bellwether to a trade deal.\u201d\nThe S&P 500 climbed 26.94 points, or 0.9%, to 3,168.57. The index is up about 0.5% from its last all-time closing high on Nov. 27.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 220.75, or 0.8%, to 28,132.05. The Nasdaq gained 63.27 points, or 0.7%, to 8,717.32. The index, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, is now up about 0.1% its record set on Nov. 27. \nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks climbed 12.89 points, or 0.8%, to 1,644.81.\nChina\u2019s Ministry of commerce said Thursday that its negotiators were in \u201cclose communication\u201d with their American counterparts ahead of the new round of tariffs, but gave no indication whether the trade talks were making progress.\nBut late Thursday, Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, confirmed that both sides were close to inking a modest trade deal that would suspend the new tariffs and reduce existing ones by an unspecified amount. In return, China would buy more U.S. farm products, increase American companies' access to the Chinese market and tighten protection for intellectual property rights, said Brilliant, who has been briefed by both sides.\nUncertainty over trade has been the biggest wildcard for stocks this year. The longstanding conflict has hurt manufacturing around the world and caused U.S. businesses to hold back on making investments. The saving grace for the economy has been a strong job market and consumer spending.\nSpeculation that the world\u2019s two biggest economies could be close to reaching an interim \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade agreement spurred investors on Thursday to move money into technology, industrial and other stock sectors that tend to do well when the economy is growing.\n\u201cIf we get a China trade deal, it\u2019s probably going to catalyze another 12-plus months of growth in the U.S. and globally,\u201d Phillips said.\nBanks helped lead the gains as bond prices fell, sending yields higher. Bank of America rose 3.1%. Higher yields allow banks to charge more lucrative interest rates on mortgages and other loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 1.90% from 1.79% late Wednesday. That\u2019s an unusually large increase and signals more confidence in economic growth.\nTechnology companies also made strong gains. The sector is one of the most sensitive to swings in trade because many of the companies rely on China for sales and supply chains. Cisco Systems climbed 3.1%.\nInvestors bid up shares in Delta Air Lines 2.9% after the most profitable U.S. carrier gave investors a surprisingly good profit and revenue forecast for 2020. The company said it expects sustained demand for air travel and stable prices for jet fuel.\nSouthwest Airlines gained 0.9% after it reached a deal with Boeing for compensation over the grounding of the 737 Max aircraft.\nTraders hammered shares in Tailored Brands after the owner of Men's Wearhouse issued quarterly forecasts below what analysts were expecting. The stock skidded 11.1% and is down 68.4% so far this year.\nWhile investors continue to wait for an official word on a possible U.S.-China trade deal, they\u2019ll get a look at new economic data Friday. The Commerce Department is due to report its November snapshot of retail sales. Economists expect retail sales rose last month. The measure gives more insight into consumer spending, which has been among the brighter spots in the economy helping to push growth.\nBenchmark crude oil rose 42 cents to settle at $59.18 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gained 48 cents to close at $64.20 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline was unchanged at $1.63 per gallon. Heating oil climbed 2 cents to $1.95 per gallon. Natural gas rose 9 cents to $2.33 per 1,000 cubic feet.\nGold fell $2.70 to $1,466.70 per ounce, silver rose 11 cents to $16.85 per ounce and copper rose 1 cent to $2.79 per pound.\nThe dollar rose to 109.34 Japanese yen from 108.51 yen on Wednesday. The euro weakened to $1.1112 from $1.1140.\nMajor stock indexes in Europe closed broadly higher.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAP Business Writer Damian J.
