The sub was never used and Unsworth called it nothing more than a \u201cPR stunt\u201d and said Musk could stick the craft \u201cwhere it hurts.\u201d\n\u201cIt was wrong and insulting, so I insulted him back,\u201d the billionaire said in federal court in Los Angeles. \u201cIt was an unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids.\u201d\nUnsworth\u2019s lawyers argue that Musk\u2019s tweet overshadowed what should have been one of the diver\u2019s proudest moments and left him no choice but to sue.\nAt the time, Musk said he didn\u2019t know Unsworth had helped with the rescue. He said his tweet wasn\u2019t asserted as a fact.\n\u201cJust as I felt he didn\u2019t mean to sodomize me with a submarine, I likewise didn\u2019t think (\u201cpedo guy\u201d) required any clarification,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI will say it again, I apologize to Mr. Unsworth.\u201d\nUnsworth is seeking unspecified damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress from the tech entrepreneur whose net worth exceeds $20 billion.\nMusk\u2019s lawyer, Alex Spiro, said earlier that Unsworth deserves nothing for what he called \u201cjoking, taunting tweets in a fight between men.\u201d\nThe shame and mortification Unsworth said he experienced is undercut by the attention he received after the rescue, Spiro said, including honors from the Thai king and British prime minister and offers from agents and film crews.\nMusk deleted the July 15, 2018, tweets and apologized on Twitter, though subsequent statements he made have called into question what he meant.\nIn an email to a Buzzfeed reporter seeking comment on the threat of a lawsuit by Unsworth\u2019s lawyer, Musk wrote the journalist \u201cshould stop defending child rapists,\u201d followed by expletives.\nMusk maintained his composure throughout an afternoon of questioning from Unsworth\u2019s lawyer, who called him as his first witness.\nDressed in a charcoal suit and white shirt, Musk calmly answered the questions and slipped in an occasional droll remark that drew snickers from jurors and the gallery.\nWhen asked about the final line of his email to the Buzzfeed reporter that said he hoped Unsworth would sue him, Musk quipped: \u201cI guess be careful what you wish for.\u201d\nThroughout the testimony, he didn\u2019t back down from his assertion that he didn\u2019t mean pedophile in his tweet, saying it was only meant as \u201ccreepy old man\u201d where he grew up in South Africa, though he said the phrase was widely used across the English language.\nUnsworth\u2019s lawyers laughed off that explanation, saying Musk responded to a question on Twitter about whether he had accused Unsworth of being a pedophile with another tweet that said, \u201cBet ya a signed dollar it\u2019s true.\u201d\nMusk also made a crack about that tweet, joking that it was a \u201cvery high stakes situation.\u201d\n\u201cIf I really thought that it was true, I would have said more than a dollar,\u201d he testified.\nMusk admitted one of his staffers tried to enlist a man to dig up dirt on Unsworth, but the investigator turned out to be a con man who got $52,000 for his efforts and produced nothing damning about Unsworth.\nThe lawsuit is not the first time Musk\u2019s tweets have landed him in hot water.\nMusk and Tesla reached a $40 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year over allegations he misled investors with a tweet declaring he had secured financing to buy out the electric car maker. He agreed in the settlement to have future tweets about the company screened.\nHe went back to court on accusations he violated that agreement by tweeting a misleading figure about how many cars Tesla would manufacture this year. The SEC sought to hold him in contempt of court, which led to a new agreement imposing tighter controls on Musk's tweets about the company.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThis story has been corrected to show Musk did not call a diver a pedophile and claimed his use of \u201cpedo guy\u201d was merely an insult."}
