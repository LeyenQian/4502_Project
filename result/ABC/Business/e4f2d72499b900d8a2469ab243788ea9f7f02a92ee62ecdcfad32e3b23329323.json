Ethnic state rulers take turns as Malaysia\u2019s monarch under a rotating system.\nLow at the time was an adviser and close associate of the then-king, he said.\nThe fund ran into problems over its Islamic bond issuance and the Cabinet \u201creluctantly\u201d agreed to take over in 2009 to prevent embarrassment to the king and adverse impact on the country\u2019s bond market, he said.\nNajib, 66, didn\u2019t say what Low\u2019s role was after the takeover. He said Low \u201chas shown himself to be a very influential figure in the Middle East\u201d and could help draw investments for 1MDB.\nHe said the 1MDB directors remained the same and that it was 1MDB\u2019s idea to form SRC in 2011. He said he wasn\u2019t aware of company clauses giving him key power in SRC but that it wasn\u2019t unusual in government-linked companies.\nNajib denies any wrongdoing and accuses Malaysia\u2019s new government of seeking political vengeance. His alliance\u2019s shocking loss in May 2018 elections led to Malaysia\u2019s first change of government since independence from Britain in 1957.\nU.S. investigators say more than $4.5 billion stolen from 1MDB was laundered through layers of bank accounts in the U.S. and other countries to finance Hollywood films and buy hotels, a luxury yacht, art works, jewelry and other extravagances. More than $700 million from the fund allegedly landed in Najib\u2019s bank account.\nThis is the first of five criminal cases against Najib over 1MDB corruption. His wife, several officials from his government, and the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs also face charges related to the scandal.\nNajib\u2019s defense will show he is also \u201ca victim\u201d of a scheme devised by Low and his cohorts, Najib\u2019s lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah told reporters during lunch break Tuesday. Low bribed the management of 1MDB and SRC to do his bidding and kept Najib in the dark, the lawyer said.\nLow is wanted in both Malaysia and the U.S. and currently in hiding,\nNajib has shown he \u201chas nothing to fear\u201d by subjecting himself to cross-examination in the stand, Shafee added.\nThe patrician former leader, whose father and uncles were the country\u2019s second and third prime ministers respectively, could face years in prison if convicted."}
