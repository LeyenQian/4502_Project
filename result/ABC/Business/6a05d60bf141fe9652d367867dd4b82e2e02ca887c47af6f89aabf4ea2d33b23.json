Macron himself remained \u201ccalm and determined\u201d to push it through, according to a top presidential official.\nIn Paris, small groups of masked activists smashed store windows, set fires and hurled flares on the sidelines of a march that was otherwise peaceful. Demonstrators also shot firecrackers at police in body armor. Some journalists were mugged in the street.\nThe Louvre closed some of its galleries, and the Palace of Versailles shut down. Subway stations across Paris closed their gates, high-speed TGV trains canceled their runs, and nearly 20% of flights at Paris\u2019 Orly Airport were reported grounded.\nMany visitors, including the U.S. energy secretary, canceled plans to travel to one of the world\u2019s most popular tourist destinations.\nSome travelers showed support for the striking workers. Others complained about being embroiled in someone else\u2019s fight.\n\"I had no idea about the strike happening, and I was waiting for two hours in the airport for the train to arrive, and it didn't arrive,\u201d said vacationer Ian Crossen, from New York. \"I feel a little bit frustrated. And I've spent a lot of money. I've spent money I didn't need to, apparently.\u201d\nBeneath the Eiffel Tower, tourists from Thailand, Canada and Spain echoed those sentiments.\nParis authorities barricaded the presidential palace and deployed 6,000 police officers. Police ordered all businesses, cafes and restaurants in the area to close and detained 71 people before the demonstration even started.\nAuthorities banned protests in the more sensitive neighborhoods around the Champs-Elysees avenue, the presidential palace, Parliament and Notre Dame Cathedral.\nHealth workers showed up to decry conditions in hospitals. Students pointed to recent student suicides and demanded government action. Environmentalists emphasized that climate justice and social justice are one and the same.\nAnd young and old roundly condemned the new retirement plan, which they fear would take money out of their pockets and reduce the leisure period the French expect have come to expect in the last decades of their lives.\nSkirmishes broke out between police firing tear gas and protesters throwing flares in the western city of Nantes, and thousands of red-vested union activists marched through cities from Marseille on the Mediterranean to Lille in the north.\nLacking public transportation, commuters used shared bikes or electric scooters despite near-freezing temperatures. Many people in the Paris region worked from home or took a day off to stay with their children, since 78% of teachers in the capital went on strike.\nThe big question is how long the walkout will last. Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne said she expects the travel troubles to be just as bad on Friday, and unions said they will maintain the Paris subway strike at least through Monday.\nJoseph Kakou, who works an overnight security shift in western Paris, walked an hour to get to his home on the eastern side of town.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t please us to walk. It doesn\u2019t please us to have to strike,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are obliged to, because we can\u2019t work until 90 years old.\u201d\nThe deeply unpopular Macron is expected to reveal the details of his plan next week. The government has promised not to touch the official retirement age \u2014 62, though lower for certain physically demanding occupations \u2014 but the plan will encourage some people to work longer.\nTo Macron, the retirement reform         is central to his plan to transform France so it can compete globally in the 21st century. The government argues France\u2019s 42 retirement systems need streamlining.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAngela Charlton, Sylvie Corbet, Alex Turnbull, Nicolas Garriga, Mstyslav Chernov and Francois Mori in Paris contributed to this report."}
