Musk, meanwhile, built a submarine with a team of engineers and sent it to the Thai Navy to aid in the rescue efforts.\n\nThe diver called the submarine a \"PR stunt\" in an interview with CNN, saying that Musk \"can stick his submarine where it hurts.\"\n\nMusk then lashed out at Unsworth and wrote in the tweet at the center of the lawsuit: \"We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problem. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\"\n\nHe admitted in court Tuesday he had never heard of Unsworth until seeing him in the CNN interview and did not know about his involvement in the cave rescue beforehand. Musk called Unsworth's claims an unprovoked attack on a good-natured act.\nIn the original complaint filed in 2018, attorneys for Unsworth argue that the word \"pedo\" \"is a well-recognized shorthand phrase for the term pedophile.\"\n\n\"As one of the highest-profile and wealthiest individuals in the world, Musk knew that this accusations against Mr. Unsworth would be conveyed to a worldwide audience and would result in the accusations receiving massive publicity,\" the court documents state.\n\nUnder questioning in court, Musk said Tuesday that some people found him influential -- and others do not.\n\nMoreover, lawyers for Unsworth argue that Musk doubled down on the accusation -- emailing a BuzzFeed News reporter and claiming Unsworth has a \"child bride,\" among other allegations, according to Unsworth\u2019s lawyers.\n\nMusk concluded the note to the reporter with: \"I f------ hope he sues me,\" according to the complaint.\nMusk defended his tirade in a court declaration filed in September 2019, saying he had watched the CNN interview Unsworth gave and that his tweets were \"responding to Mr. Unsworth\u2019s false claims and attack on the effort and character of my team and me.\"\n\n\"By referring to Mr. Unsworth as 'pedo guy,' I did not intend to convey any facts or imply that Mr. Unsworth had engaged in acts of pedophilia,\" the court filing said. \"'Pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up. It is synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person\u2019s appearance and demeanor, not accuse a person of acts of pedophilia.\"\nMusk added that his email to the BuzzFeed News reporter was labeled \"off the record,\" and he did not expect them to publish its contents without verifying it themselves.\n\nUnsworth is seeking more than $75,000 in damages, attorney fees, and a court order stopping Musk from making further allegations.\n\nAttorneys for Unsworth and Musk did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nUltimately, the 12 boys and their coach stuck in the cave were rescued by a team of international divers. Musk's submarine was not used.\n\nABC News' Alyssa Pone contributed to this report. "}
