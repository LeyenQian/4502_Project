That appears to be a direct response to the recent lament from French President Emmanuel Macron of a \u201cbrain death\u201d in the trans-Atlantic military alliance.\n\u201cWe stand together, all for one and one for all,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after meeting at a luxury hotel and golf resort. \u201cOur commitment to Article 5, the collective defense clause of our alliance, is iron-clad.\u201d\nAhead of the summit, Macron had complained about a lack of U.S. leadership. President Donald Trump branded his remarks as \u201cvery disrespectful,\u201d while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested that Macron himself was \u201cbrain dead.\u201d\nThe infighting is mostly due to Turkey\u2019s offensive in northern Syria, which began in October. Macron has complained that Trump pulled U.S. troops out of the region without warning his NATO allies; a move that Turkey saw as a greenlight to send its troops in.\nCountries across the European Union are particularly concerned as to what may transpire. The worry in many EU capitals is that some extremist fighters escaped during Turkey\u2019s offensive, and that the fighting could spark a new wave of refugees.\nTo help ease tensions, leaders agreed to \u201ca forwarding-looking reflection process\u201d to be led by Stoltenberg. Details were sketchy, but the commission, \u201cdrawing on relevant expertise,\u201d would study ways \u201cto further strengthen NATO\u2019s political dimension including consultation.\u201d\nGermany and France had both put forward similar schemes, although Macron riled many allies with his pre-summit remarks and NATO officials have pointedly suggested that they were more impressed by Berlin\u2019s proposal.\nAfter three summits in consecutive years, the leaders decided that they would take a year off and meet again in 2021. That means there won\u2019t be another one until after the next presidential election in the United States, which is by far NATO\u2019s most powerful and influential member country.\nEarlier, summit host Prime Minister Boris Johnson \u2014 also busy with a divisive British election campaign \u2014 was one of many leaders who played down the organization\u2019s differences.\n\u201cClearly it is very important that the alliance stays together, but there is far, far more that unites us than divides us,\u201d Johnson said.\nHe said NATO\u2019s success is due to \u201cthe very simple concept of safety in numbers. At the heart of it is a pledge that we will come to one another\u2019s defense: all for one and one for all.\"\nErdogan didn\u2019t speak to waiting media. Trump arrived via a different entrance, away from media and said he would leave without holding a press conference.\nIn a tweet, he said: \u201cWe won\u2019t be doing a press conference at the close of NATO because we did so many over the past two days. Safe travels to all!\u201d\nMacron refused to apologize for his remarks, saying they had ignited a debate at NATO about important strategic issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s allowed us to raise fundamental debates,\u201d he said, chief among them being \u201chow to build sustainable peace in Europe.\u201d\nHe said NATO \u201cdebates should be about other things than budgets and finances.\u201d\nStoltenberg noted that European allies and Canada have added $130 billion to their defense spending since 2016, even as Trump has complained that they are too slow to boost their military budgets.\n\u201cThis is unprecedented, this is making us stronger,\u201d Stoltenberg said of the spending effort.\nAfter Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, NATO countries halted their post-Cold War spending cuts and began to raise spending. They pledged to \u201cmove toward\u201d spending 2% of their annual GDP on national defense by 2024.\nTrump said Tuesday that much more needs to be done.\n\u201cYou could make the case that they\u2019ve been delinquent for 25-30 years,\u201d Trump said. The figure of 2%, he added, \u201cis a very low number, it really should be 4.\u201d\nLuxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel conceded that \u201cwe have experienced easier times. But we\u2019re allies after all and we\u2019re going to speak about everything.\u201d\n\u201cThe atmosphere last night was much more relaxed than what I expected after hearing what had happened over the last 24 hours. But I think differences can arise. We just have to talk about them,\u201d Bettel said, referring to receptions late Tuesday at Buckingham Palace and at Downing Street."}
