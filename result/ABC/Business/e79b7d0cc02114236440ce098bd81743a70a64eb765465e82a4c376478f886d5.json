Tim Walz. \u201cJuul is by far the dominant e-cigarette manufacturer in America, and it's growing fast.\u201d\nEllison declined to put a dollar figure on how much money the state will seek in damages and civil penalties. But he said it could be in line with the state's landmark $7 billion settlement with the tobacco industry in 1998. He said the San Francisco-based company followed \u201cBig Tobacco's playbook\u201d of marketing to young people.\nJuul issued a statement saying it's \u201cworking cooperatively\" with attorneys general, regulators and other stakeholders to prevent underage use of its products and to switch adult smokers away from conventional cigarettes. The company said it recently stopped accepting orders for mint-flavored pods in the U.S. and suspended all its broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the country.\n\u201cOur customer base is the world's 1 billion adult smokers and we do not intend to attract underage users,\" the statement said.\nJuul Labs \u2014 which is          facing a growing number of state and federal investigations into its marketing and sales \u2014 is about         one-third owned by tobacco giant Altria, the maker of Marlboro and other popular brands.\nThe Minnesota lawsuit is separate from         lawsuits filed by several other states in the last two weeks.\nEllison said Juul created a public nuisance and violated Minnesota's consumer protection laws by developing \u201cproducts with higher, more potent and more addictive doses of nicotine than conventional cigarettes, and other e-cigarettes, then not only failed to disclose that to its customers, but represented that its products were safe alternatives to cigarettes.\"\nWalz said Juul knew the harm when it deliberately targeted Minnesota's children \u201cfor simple greed and simple profit.\u201d Using the money Minnesota received under the 1998 settlement, he said, the state brought youth tobacco use way down \u201cuntil the scourge of vaping\" came along.\nThe attorney general's office hired two outside law firms, Robbins Kaplan and Zimmerman Reed, to represent the state. Robbins Kaplan also represented Minnesota in the epic litigation that led to the 1998 settlement, which forced the industry to turn over millions of pages of previously undisclosed documents on its practices.\nWalz and Ellison warned that the new lawsuit could take years and draw an army of high-priced company lawyers, as the 1998 case did.\n\u201cAnd they will use their merchant of death playbook to tell us we're bad parents, to tell us we have bad kids, to tell us that we should have known,\" Walz said \u201c... But my message to Juul if they're listening today is, you can hire your attorneys, you will have your day in court, but we will bring the righteous justice of the state of Minnesota down on Juul.\"\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCorrects quote in last paragraph. Walz said \u201cbut we will bring the righteous justice of the state of Minnesota down on Juul,\" rather than \u201cbut we will bring the righteous justice of the state of Minnesota upon you.\""}
