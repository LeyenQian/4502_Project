That is more than 20 delays a day during the peak summer travel season.\nAmerican says catering-related delays at DFW have been getting worse for years, and it has a solution: a new $100 million kitchen.\nThe DFW Airport board is scheduled to vote on the project Thursday after hearing a presentation earlier this week. \n\u201cThe current catering kitchen was built in 1982 and is too small and inefficient for today's needs,\u201d airline spokeswoman Annie Lorenzana said. \u201cA new kitchen is critical to enable future expansion,\u201d including when a new, sixth terminal that opens as soon as 2025.\nAmerican is the dominant carrier at DFW, operating more than 900 flights a day. The airline outsources catering to LSG Sky Chefs.\nIf the airport board approves the project, American will negotiate a 40-year lease for more than 21 acres to house a new kitchen and related facilities. It would pay an estimated $39 million in rent over the life of the lease, in addition to the upfront costs, according to airport documents.\nAmerican has struggled with more than 30,000 delays at DFW this year. Airline executives blamed the operational problems this summer at DFW and other airports on the grounding of American's 24 Boeing Max jets and an illegal work slowdown by union mechanics. \nPlans for the new kitchen were first reported by The Dallas Morning News.
