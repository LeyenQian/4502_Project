The previous month saw a decline of 43,000 jobs in manufacturing, also likely due to the strike.\n\nThe average work week remained unchanged in November at 34.4 hours a week. In manufacturing, however, the average work week increased slightly, by 0.1 hours, to 40.5 hours a week, as overtime decreased by 0.1 hours.\n\nAn average of 180,000 jobs have been added per month so far in 2019 compared to an average gain of 223,000 in 2018. Friday's report also revised September's and October's figures to indicate 41,000 more jobs were added than previously reported.\n"}
