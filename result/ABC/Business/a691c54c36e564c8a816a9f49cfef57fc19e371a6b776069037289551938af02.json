Investors had hoped for at least enough progress to stave off new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, including smartphones and laptops, scheduled to start Dec. 15.\nTensions flared last week after Trump signed legislation expressing U.S. support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong.\n\u201cUntil both sides dial down their hawkish rhetoric, markets will continue to pull back earlier optimism,\u201d said DBS Group analysts in a report. \u201cTrade war will be the key driver of sentiment in the immediate few weeks.\u201d\nTokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 index sank 1.03% to 23,141.68 and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gave up 1.2% to 26,077.77.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.3% to 2,874.88 and Seoul\u2019s Kospi declined 0.8% to 2,060.81. Australia\u2019s S&P-ASX 200 fell 1.4% to 6,621.40 and benchmarks in Taiwan, New Zealand and Southeast Asia also retreated.\nIndia\u2019s Sensex bucked the trend, opening up 0.1% to 40,724.00.\nOn Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.7% to 3,093.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1% to 27,502.81. The Nasdaq dropped 0.6% to 8,520.64.\nNegotiators have yet to agree on details of an interim deal Trump has called \"Phase 1.\"\nInvestors also are weighing the potential for additional trade disputes.\nOn Tuesday, Trump proposed tariffs on $2.4 billion in French products in retaliation for a tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook. That follows a threat Monday to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum from Argentina and Brazil.\nAlso Wednesday, Australia disappointed investors by reporting third-quarter economic growth declined to 0.4% over the previous quarter from 0.6% in the three months ending in June. The Australian central bank had described the economy as experiencing a \"gentle upturn.\u201d\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 42 cents to $56.52 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 14 cents on Tuesday to close at $56.10. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 49 cents to $61.31 per barrel in London. It lost 10 cents the previous session to $60.82.\nCURRENCY: The dollar declined to 108.58 yen from Tuesday\u2019s 108.63 yen. The euro edged down to $1.1077 from $1.1084."}
