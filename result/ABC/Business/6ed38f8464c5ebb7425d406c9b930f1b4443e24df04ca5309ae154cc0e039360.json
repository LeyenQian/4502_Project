They will eventually replace United\u2019s 53 Boeing 757-200s.\nTerms weren\u2019t released. United also will delay delivery of larger Airbus A350s.\nThe decision is a setback for Boeing, which is also based in Chicago and is reeling from the grounding of its 737 Max jets after two deadly crashes.\nUnited Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella says the Max doesn\u2019t have the range of the A321XLR and Boeing hasn\u2019t decided whether to build a new mid-size plane.\nHe says United will use the Airbus jets mostly between the East Coast and Europe."}
