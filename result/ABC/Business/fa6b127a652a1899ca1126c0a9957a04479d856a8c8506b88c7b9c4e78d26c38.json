We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations.\u201d \u2014 remarks with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\nTHE FACTS: He is wildly wrong to state that the U.S. never won victories in disputes taken to the trade organization before him.\nThe U.S. has always had a high success rate when it pursues cases against other countries at the WTO. In 2017, trade analyst Daniel Ikenson of the libertarian Cato Institute found that the U.S. had won 91% of times it brought a complaint that ended up being adjudicated by the Geneva-based trade monitor. \nAs Ikenson noted, countries bringing complaints to the organization tend to win because they don't bother going to the WTO in the first place if they don't have a strong case.\nAs for his claim that the U.S. \u201cwon\u201d $7.5 billion from the WTO, that's not quite right.\nTrump was referring to a WTO decision         in October  siding with the U.S. on imposing tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European imports annually. The value of the tariffs on those imports is much less than $7.5 billion.\nThe WTO announcement culminated a 15-year fight over EU subsidies for Airbus \u2014 a fight that began long before Trump was in office.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTRUMP: \u201cWe have a tremendous amount of captured fighters, ISIS fighters over in Syria. And, they're all under lock and key, but many are from France, many are from Germany. Many are from U.K. They are mostly from Europe.\u201d \u2014 remarks with French President Emmanuel Macron.\nMACRON: There are \u201cvery large number of fighters ... ISIS fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq and the region.\u201d Those from Europe are \"a tiny minority of the overall problem.\"\nTHE FACTS: Trump is incorrect to say the Islamic State fighters who were captured and held by the Kurds in Syria are mostly from Europe. \nOf the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. Most of the captured fighters \u2014 about 10,000 \u2014 are natives of Syria or Iraq.\nEuropean nations have indeed been reluctant to take detainees who came from Europe, frustrating Trump. But such detainees are far fewer than the majority he frequently claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTRUMP, speaking about claims that Britain's state-funded health care system would be part of future U.K.-U.S. trade talks: \u201cI don't even know where that rumor started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn't want to. If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.\u201d \u2014 remarks with Jens Stoltenberg.\nTHE FACTS: He's referring to his own past statements as a \u201crumor.\u201d\nAsked about the National Health Service during a visit to Britain in June, he said \u201cwhen you're dealing in trade, everything\u2019s on the table. So, NHS or anything else.\"\nThe service, which provides free health care to all Britons, could in fact be a bargaining chip in U.S.-U.K. trade talks. U.S. health-services firms can already bid for contracts if they have European subsidiaries. A future government could increase the amount of private-sector involvement or let U.S. companies bid directly. \nAs well, the U.S. could demand during trade talks that Britain pay American pharma firms more for drugs. Medicines became a big issue in negotiations on a revamped North American free trade deal, as the U.S. pushed successfully for tighter restrictions on the development in Canada and Mexico of generic versions of U.S.-patented drugs.\nLeaked documents from preliminary talks between U.S. and U.K. negotiators over two years from July 2017 \u2014 released by the Labour Party last week \u2014 said \u201cpatent issues\u201d around \u201cNHS access to generic drugs will be a key consideration\u201d in talks.\nIt\u2019s an overstatement to say the national health service as a whole would be up for sale, as Labour has alleged will happen if Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives win the Dec. 12 election and try to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the U.S. Britain would not be \u201cselling off\u201d the health service, as Labour asserts, because taxpayers would still be footing the bill.\nBut it's also improbable to think U.S. negotiators would \u201cwant nothing to do\" with Britain's health care market, despite Trump\u2019s words.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTRUMP, on protecting oilfields in Syria: \u201cWe have the oil, and we can do with the oil what we want.\" \u2014 remarks with Stoltenberg.\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s not true. The oil in Syria belongs to Syria and the U.S. can\u2019t do anything it wants with it.\nAs secretary of state, Rex Tillerson reviewed whether the U.S. could make money off the oil-rich areas and concluded there was no practical way to do so, said Brett McGurk, Trump's former special envoy to the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State. \u201cMaybe there are new lawyers now, but it was just illegal for an American company to go and seize and exploit these assets,\u201d McGurk         told a panel on Syria held in October by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\nStephen Vladeck, a national security law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said there is no solid legal argument the Trump administration could make if it sought to claim Syria's oil.\nWhile Trump has said he will withdraw the bulk of roughly 1,000 American troops from Syria, he\u2019s made clear he will leave some military forces in the country to help secure the oil from any Islamic State resurgence.\nThe Pentagon has said it is committed to sending additional military forces to eastern Syria to \"reinforce\" control of the oil fields and prevent them from \u201cfalling back to into the hands of ISIS or other destabilizing actors.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nEDITOR'S NOTE \u2014 A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nLawless reported from London.
