He said the board believes the company can grow faster in 2020.\nDiller and Vice Chairman Peter Kern will manage day-to-day operations, and Chief Strategy Officer Eric Hart will be acting CFO.\nOkerstrom joined Expedia in 2006, rose to CFO in 2011 and was named CEO in August 2017, when Dara Khosrowshahi left to become the CEO of Uber.\nExpedia said the board also authorized the buyback of up to 20 million more shares on top of 9 million shares that can be repurchased under a previous decision. \nShares of Expedia Group Inc. rose $6.23, or 6.3%, to $105.62 in midday trading.
