Some have welcomed her work, including her speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming. But others have criticized her sometimes combative tone. \n\"For sounding the alarm about humanity\u2019s predatory relationship with the only home we have, for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends backgrounds and borders, for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads, Greta Thunberg is Time\u2019s 2019 Person of the Year,\u201d the media franchise said on its         website.     \nAs she left a U.N. climate conference in Madrid, Thunberg told The Associated Press that she was \u201ca bit surprised\u201d at the recognition. \n\u201cI could never have imagined anything like that happening,\u201d she said in a phone interview.\n\u201cI'm of course, very grateful for that, very honored,\u201d Thunberg said, but added: \"It should be everyone in the Fridays for Future movement because what we have done, we have done together.\u201d\nThunberg said she hoped the message being pushed by her and other activists \u2014 that governments need to drastically increase their efforts to combat climate change \u2014 is finally getting through. The \u201cGreta effect\u201d has already been linked to a rise in support for environmental parties in Europe.\nBut she insisted that the media should also pay attention to other activists, particularly indigenous people, whom she said \u201care hit hardest by the climate and environmental crisis.\"\nHer concern over the slayings of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon drew a harsh rebuke from the Latin American nation's president Tuesday. \n\u201cGreta said that the Indians died because they were defending the Amazon,\u201d Jair Bolsonaro said. \u201cIt's impressive that the press is giving space to a brat like that,\u201d he added, using the Portuguese word \u201dpirralha.\"\nThunberg responded by changing her bio on Twitter, where she has over 3 million followers, to say \u201cPirralha.\"\nThe teenager has also been a strong advocate of science, regularly citing complex studies about the causes and impacts of climate change. \nOn Wednesday, Thunberg used her address at the U.N.'s         annual climate summit to accuse governments and businesses of misleading the public by holding talks that she said aren't going to stop the world's \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d\n\u201cThe real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR,\u201d she said.\nThunberg cited scientific reports showing that national pledges to reduce reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions aren't enough to meet the ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsis (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.\n\"This is not leading, this is misleading,\u201d she told officials, adding that \u201cevery fraction of a degree matters.\u201d\nThunberg said the youth climate movement, which has staged repeated worldwide protests attended by hundreds of thousands of people, has managed to spread awareness about the need to urgently emissions and help those already affected by global warming.\n\u201cTo get in a sense of urgency in the conversation that is very needed right now to be able to move forward,\u201d she said. \"That, I think, is our biggest success.\u201d\nAsked whether she thought world leaders were beginning to respond to this message, Thunberg told the AP: \u201cThey say they listen and they say they understand, but it sure doesn't seem like it.\u201d\n\u201cIf they really would listen and understand then I think they need to prove that by translating that into action,\u201d she added. \nThunberg said the experience of the past 15 months, going from solo-protester outside the Swedish parliament to speaking in front of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, had changed her.\n\"I think life is much more meaningful now that I have something to do that has an impact,\" she said.\nThunberg has tried to preserve some privacy despite the relentless interest she's received from media and adoring fans.\nShe was mobbed on her arrival in Madrid last week and the attention paid to her appearances at the climate conference has far outstripped that of other events, save for Hollywood stars like Harrison Ford.\n\u201cI would like to be left alone,\u201d Thunberg said when asked about her immediate plans. But before heading home to Sweden, to spend Christmas with her family and dogs, she will attend a climate protest Friday in Turin, Italy.\n\u201cAfter that, I have no school to return to until August because I've taken a gap year,\u201d she said.\n\"I will probably continue a bit like now, travel around. And if I get invitations, to come. And just try everything I can,\" she added.\nLast year\u2019s Time winners included slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi; the staff of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, where five people were shot to death; Philippine journalist Maria Ressa; and two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nKiley Armstrong in New York contributed to this report.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow AP\u2019s climate coverage at         https://www.apnews.com/Climate \u2014\u2014\u2014 The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
