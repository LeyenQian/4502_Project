It\u2019s normal we fight for ourselves and for the future generations,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, it will be difficult, but if we need to do it, we will.\u201d\nBoth are still years away from having to live off a pension, but Le Faucheur wants to show solidarity with his uncle, who has been a metro driver for the Paris public transport company RATP for 11 years.\nThey want the government to abandon its plans.\nUnder the current system, both have a special pension linked to their job and company, allowing Le Faucheur to retire at a minimum age of 57 and his uncle at 52.\nWith the proposal, Macron\u2019s government wants to apply one set of rules to all new pensioners, saying it will make the system fairer and simpler. It would replace the current 42 pension regimes that apply to various professions and can include specific provisions, like early retirement for train workers. All French retirees receive a state pension. The overall legal retirement age is 62.\nThe industrial action illustrates the mounting fears across generations that people will have to work longer for less.\nThursday\u2019s strikes are expected to snarl transport, with trains remaining in their depots and flights delayed or cancelled. Thousands of schools will be closed, and garbage may not be collected as many workers, mostly from the public sector, have joined the movement.\nSome public hospital workers will go to the Paris march and police unions are calling for a symbolic protest, too.\nBoth Pierre and Le Faucheur concede that their current pension arrangements are favorable, but they argue that it\u2019s fair compensation for the many constraints that go with their jobs, like working on weekends and holidays.\nPierre, a member of the left-wing Solidaires union, feels very attached to France\u2019s history of social rights.\n\u201cThe five weeks of paid vacation, the social security, we got all that through social struggles from people who sacrificed themselves financially for us to get that,\u201d he said.\nRetiring later, he said, likely means retiring with health problems.\n\u201cWhat do we want for our retirement years? To enjoy it or being a retiree in a hospital or in a bed and not being able to enjoy life?\u201d\nThe upcoming strikes are the latest in a long line of protests since Macron came to power in 2017. Most center on changes to the labor market, which Macron insisted during his election were necessary for France to become a more dynamic economy.\nThe worry for Macron\u2019s government is that the strikes could re-ignite the yellow vest protests, which erupted in November 2018 and quickly turned into a broader movement for more economic and social justice and were against Macron\u2019s policies seen as favoring the rich.\nPierre feels a sense of solidarity with the yellow vests, some of whom are expected to join the protests.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing social gap between the poorest and the richest,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are more and more retirees who can\u2019t make it at the end of the month.\u201d\nFrench political scientist Dominique Andolfatto said the planned reforms concern everyone and that the government has not communicated its intentions clearly. Details on the pensions won\u2019t be known until the bill is presented next year.\nAs a result, he said the planned reforms have \u201ccreated anxiety within the population.\u201d\nLe Faucheur and Pierre say they understand the hurdles they face.\n\u201cI have concerns because I know this reform for Macron is the priority of his term\u201d, Pierre said. \u201cBut on the other hand, I think that the French now are aware we need to join together in solidarity.\u201d"}
