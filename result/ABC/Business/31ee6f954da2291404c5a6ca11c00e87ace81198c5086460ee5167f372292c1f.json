More than 40 people were killed and dozens injured as protesters clashed with police. Mo\u00efse insisted he would not resign and called for dialogue. \nThe United Nations World Food Program says a recent survey found that one in three Haitians, or 3.7 million people, need urgent food assistance and 1 million are experiencing severe hunger. The WFP, which says it is trying to get emergency food assistance to 700,000 people, blames rising prices, the weakening local currency, and a drop in agricultural production due partly to the disruption of recent protests.\nIn the last two years, Haiti\u2019s currency, the gourde, declined 60% against the dollar and inflation recently reached 20%, Chalmers said. The rising cost of food is especially crucial in the country of nearly 11 million people. Some 60% make less than $2 a day and 25% earn less than $1 a day. \nA 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag of rice has more than doubled in price in the local currency, said Marcelin Saingiles, a store owner who sells everything from cold drinks to cookies to used tools in Port-au-Prince. \nThe 39-year-old father of three children said he now struggles to buy milk and vegetables. \n\u201cI feed the kids, but they\u2019re not eating the way they\u2019re supposed to,\u201d he said, adding that he has drained the funds set aside for his children\u2019s schooling to buy food. \nA growing number of families across Haiti can\u2019t even afford to do that since the protests began, with barricades preventing the flow of goods between the capital and the rest of the country. \nMany of those live in Haiti\u2019s rural areas, which also have been hardest hit by demonstrations that continue in some cities and towns. \nWadlande Pierre, 23, said she temporarily moved in with her aunt in the southwest town of Les Cayes to escape the violent protests in Port-au-Prince. However, she had to move back to the capital because there was not gas, power or water in Les Cayes, and food was becoming scarce. \n\u201cThere is no access to basic items that you need,\u201d she said. \nPierre is now helping her mother, Vanlancia Julien, sell fruits and vegetables on a sidewalk in the neighborhood of Delmas in the capital. \nJulien said she recently lost a couple hundred dollars\u2019 worth of produce because she could not go out on the street to sell due to the protests. \n\u201cAll the melon, avocado, mango, pineapple, bananas, all of them spoiled,\u201d she said. \nLast year, sales were good, but she is now making a third of what she used to earn before the protests began, even though streets have reopened. \n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t amount to anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that people don\u2019t go out to work, it\u2019s less people moving around and makes it harder for me.\u201d \nThat also means businesses like the small restaurant that 43-year-old Widler Saint-Jean Santil owns often remain empty when they used to be full on a regular afternoon. \nHe said the protests have forced many business owners to lay off people, which in turn affects him because clients can no longer afford to eat out. \n\u201cIf people are not working, there is no business,\u201d he said. \nAmong the businesses that permanently closed was the Best Western Premier hotel, which laid off dozens of employees. \nChalmers warned that economic recovery will be slow if the political instability continues, adding that the situation is the worst Haiti has faced in recent history. \n\u201cA lot of crises came together,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only the economic one, but the political and fiscal ones.\u201d \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press writer reported this story in Port-au-Prince and AP writer Danica Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico."}
