Those included not having tested whether a faulty sensor could trigger the plane\u2019s anti-stall system, which investigators believe happened in both crashes, pushing down the noses of the planes. \nAt other times he defended Boeing\u2019s safety culture. While a couple lawmakers expressed frustration with Hamilton\u2019s answers, they reserved most of their anger for Muilenburg.\nHamilton has spent 35 years at Boeing and served as chief project engineer for several planes including the 737 NG, the version that preceded the Max. He was responsible for engineering design and safety for all Boeing airliners when the company got final approval of the Max from the Federal Aviation Administration.\nHe was named to his current position in March to deal with the accident investigations and other technical risks, according to the company. \nHe will be replaced by Lynne Hopper, vice president of engineering for Boeing's commercial airplanes business. She will be the first woman to hold the job at Boeing, a company spokesman said.\nBoeing\u2019s expectations for returning the Max to flight have been set back several times. Boeing engineers began updating flight-control software called MCAS shortly after it was determined to have played a role in the crash of a Lion Air Max off the coast of Indonesia in October 2018. They were still working on the software when an Ethiopian Airlines Max crashed near Addis Ababa in March. \nThe company\u2019s hopes for a quick return to service were dashed in June, when test pilots for the Federal Aviation Administration discovered a separate problem involving flight computers during a session in a flight simulator. The three U.S. airlines that own Max jets \u2014 Southwest, American and United \u2014 don\u2019t expect them back in the schedule until March."}
