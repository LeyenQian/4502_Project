The museum previously had lobbied for Navajo versions of the movies \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d that were eventually made.\n\u201cI was surprised by their enthusiasm and excitement about getting this started,\u201d Wheeler said Tuesday. \u201cWe have been looking for something aimed at preschoolers.\u201d\nSmartStudy has translated the \u201cBaby Shark\u201d tune of the viral video in 19 languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, Arabic, and Bahasa-Malay.\nThe company hopes its latest project will spark interest in the Navajo language among the tribe\u2019s young generation, SmartStudy marketing manager Kevin Yoon said in an email.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to play a role in raising awareness of and preserving a language that\u2019s in danger of vanishing through what we do best \u2014 creating fun, stimulating content to provide entertaining learning experiences to children worldwide,\u201d Yoon said.\nThe Navajo Nation is the largest Native American reservation in the U.S. The Navajo word for shark is l\u00f3\u00f3 hashk\u00e9h\u00e9, which translates to \u201cangry fish.\u201d\nThe company is seeking voice actors to portray the roles of Baby Shark, Mommy Shark, Daddy Shark, Grandma Shark, and Grandpa Shark.\nThe original \u201c         Baby Shark Dance \u201d video has garnered more than 4 billion views on YouTube.\n\u201cBaby Shark\u201d has been around for a few years, but took the world by storm last year when the song and video went viral with the nursery-school set, with little kids imitating the handclapping dance that went along with the video.\nBooks, plush toys, and other merchandise inspired by the song became hot-ticket items for the holidays and the \u201cBaby Shark\u201d tour was soon hatched.\nA second North American leg of the \u201cBaby Shark\u201d concert tour is launching in March.\nDuring the World Series, Washington Nationals fans adopted \u201cBaby Shark\u201d as the team\u2019s rally song.\nNickelodeon has a \u201cBaby Shark\u201d cartoon series in the works.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nRussell Contreras is a member of The Associated Press' race and ethnicity team.
