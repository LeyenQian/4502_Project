Nothing good can come of the trajectory we are currently on.\u201d\nThe email was sent to top airline managers and pilot leaders.\nThe incidents Hornibrook listed ranged from pilots going over airspeed limits to aircraft approaching stalls, and also included weather-induced threats that perhaps could have been avoided.\nIn an interview with the newspaper, Hornibrook and Horizon president Joe Sprague said the distribution of the email should be seen as an example of Horizon\u2019s high safety standards.\n\u201cThe memo was meant to respond to the spike we saw in irregular events,\u201d Hornibrook said. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting back and waiting for something bigger.\u201d\nHorizon Air's pilots fly Bombardier Q400 turboprops and Embraer E175 jets on routes that link smaller cities into a feeder network for Alaska Airlines.\nThe only serious accident in the airline\u2019s passenger service history happened in 1988, when a Q400 crash-landed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport after an engine fire. Four passengers suffered serious injuries.\nIn 2017, a major pilot shortage at Horizon caused hundreds of flight cancellations. In response, Horizon raised pilot pay, added signing bonuses and boosted recruitment. "}
