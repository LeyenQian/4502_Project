But others were dubious.\nChanges made during the study and unusual analyses of the data made the results hard to interpret. And the newly released results showed the drug made only a very small difference in thinking skills in one study and none in the other.\nAlzheimer\u2019s patients and families are desperate for any help, no matter how small, adding pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to approve something.\nBut with conflicting results, \"I don't see how you can conclude anything other than that another trial needs to be done,\" said the Mayo Clinic's Dr. David Knopman, who was involved in one of the studies.\nLaurie Ryan, a dementia scientist at the National Institute on Aging, agreed: \u201cWe need more evidence.\u201d\nOther doctors who consult for the drug\u2019s developers cheered the results. Dr. Paul Aisen, a dementia specialist at the University of Southern California, said they were \"consistent and positive\" in showing a benefit at a high dose \u2014 \"a truly major advance.\"\nAducanumab aims to help the body clear harmful plaques, or protein clumps, from the brain. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen is developing it with Japan\u2019s Eisai Co.\nIn afternoon trading, the companies\u2019 stocks were up roughly 4%.\nThe stakes are high for approval or denial.\nMore than 5 million people in the U.S. and millions more worldwide have Alzheimer's. Current drugs only temporarily ease symptoms and do not slow the loss of memory and thinking skills.\nBut approving a drug that isn't truly effective could expose patients to financial and medical risks and give other drugmakers less incentive to develop better treatments.\nThe makers of aducanumab undertook two studies, each enrolling about 1,650 people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia from Alzheimer's.\nThose with a gene that raises their risk of the disease were started on a lower dose because they are more likely to suffer inflammation in the brain from medicines that target plaque.\nBut as the studies went on and concern about this side effect eased, the rules were changed to let such patients get a higher dose.\nA Biogen vice president, Samantha Budd Haeberlein, said more people got the higher dose in one study, and that helps explain why it succeeded and the other one failed.\nBut the new analyses were done on partial results, and with methods not agreed upon at the outset, which makes any conclusions unreliable, independent experts said.\nAlso, the drug\u2019s benefits may have looked more impressive than they really were because patients in the placebo group worsened more in the positive study than in the one that failed.\n\"It's hard to know exactly what happened here,\" said Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer of the Alzheimer\u2019s Drug Discovery Foundation. \"I don't see how the FDA could approve it.\"\nQuestions also arose about the size of any benefit.\nThe drug did not reverse decline, only slowed the rate of it compared to the placebo group by 22% in one study. Yet that meant a difference of only 0.39 on an 18-point score of thinking skills.\n\"It's a very small amount,\" Fillit said.\nStill, Maria Carrillo, chief science officer at the Alzheimer's Association, said it was \u201cthe largest reduction that we've seen to date,\" adding: \"It may mean that they remember their loved ones a little longer.\"\nThe drug \"is worthy of significant, rigorous exploration\" and review by the FDA, she said. \"This is an important moment for the Alzheimer's community.\"\nSome doctors and patients who helped test the drug are convinced it helped.\nOne was Charles Flagg, 78, a retired minister from Jamestown, Rhode Island, who received aducanumab until the studies were halted in March. Since he was taken off the medicine, \u201chis cognition, his alertness, his interactions have definitely diminished,\" said his wife, Cynthia Flagg.\nBiogen stressed the need for an effective treatment and suggested that delaying access to a drug that may work could deprive many people of help while further study is done.\nDr. John Ioannidis, a Stanford University expert on research methods, said patients\u2019 need should not drive the FDA\u2019s decision.\n\"If we go down that path, we're likely to introduce a lot of ineffective treatments for diseases that are really common,\" he said. \"It would be a complete mess.\"\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMarilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter at         http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP     \nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives         support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
