Despite working around the clock to build the sub, Musk arrived in Thailand late in the rescue effort and the craft was never used.\nUnsworth called it nothing more than a \u201cPR stunt\u201d and said Musk could stick the sub \u201cwhere it hurts.\u201d Musk watched the CNN clip of Unsworth several times before lashing out in a series of tweets on July 15, 2018.\n\u201cIt was wrong and insulting, so I insulted him back,\u201d the billionaire said. \u201cIt was an unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids.\u201d\nUnsworth is seeking unspecified damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress from the tech entrepreneur whose net worth exceeds $20 billion.\nMusk\u2019s lawyer, Alex Spiro, said Unsworth deserves nothing for what he called \u201cjoking, taunting tweets in a fight between men.\u201d\nThe shame and mortification Unsworth said he experienced is undercut by the attention he received after the rescue, Spiro said, including honors from the Thai king and British prime minister and offers from agents and film crews.\nOn the witness stand, Musk gave answers that were at times humorous and sometimes seemed like those of an executive who's under court order to be careful what he says.\nMusk is required to have his tweets about Tesla screened as part of court settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations he posted misleading information about the company that caused wild stock swings.\nHis tweet about Unsworth caused Tesla\u2019s stock to drop about 3% the following day, though it recovered a day later.\nWith his arms crossed, Musk at times squinted and stared off in the distance as he searched for answers to events that occurred more than a year ago.\nHe clashed at one point with Unsworth's attorney, L. Lin Wood, telling him he interpreted the lawyer\u2019s letter threatening to sue as an extortion attempt.\n\u201cI get these shakedown letters a lot,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI think you\u2019re looking for a significant payday.\u201d\nMusk's attorney attempted to humanize the billionaire, having him discuss his family \u2014 15-year-old twins and 13-year-old triplets, all boys. Musk choked up talking about a son who died as a baby and his childhood in South Africa.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t good,\u201d he said.\nMusk said he was asked to help with the cave rescue and decided to get involved when he heard a Thai navy diver died in the cave system and that a monsoon was forecast that could drown the soccer team.\nMusk received no compensation for his efforts, but he acknowledged his work could have been interpreted as a publicity effort.\nThough Musk apologized for his tweet about Unsworth, subsequent statements have called into question what he meant.\nMusk responded to a question on Twitter about whether he had accused Unsworth of being a pedophile by saying, \u201cBet ya a signed dollar it\u2019s true.\u201d\nHe told a Buzzfeed reporter seeking comment on the threat of a lawsuit by Unsworth to \u201cstop defending child rapists,\u201d followed by expletives.\nMusk was asked about an attempt to dig up dirt on Unsworth.\nOne of his executives communicated with someone who said he was an investigator but who turned out to be a con man. He was paid $52,000 and produced nothing damning about the diver."}
