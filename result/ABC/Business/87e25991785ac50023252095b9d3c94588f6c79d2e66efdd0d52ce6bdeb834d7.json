Not for male/female, but for partner & employee.Anyone else think it's strange that Uber views partners & employees as two separate classes of people? pic.twitter.com/3SGeKSae3g\u2014 Erika Betts (@ErikaABetts) December 4, 2019 The @Uber hub in my market has designated bathrooms.

This is not our policy and it's absolutely unacceptable. The signs are coming down today.\u2014 Andrew Macdonald (@andrewgordonmac) December 4, 2019 Hi Erika - I looked into this. This is not our policy and it's absolutely unacceptable. The signs are coming down today.\nMacdonald added in a follow-up tweet that the \"bathroom was also being used for employee storage, but that's not an excuse. I don't believe this is the case anywhere else (and it's certainly not our design policy) but we're doing a full review now.\"\n\nAn Uber spokesperson told ABC News Thursday that the Providence Greenlight Hub was the only location with this signage and that the signs have been taken down.\nThe signs still sparked outrage on social media, and even caught the eye of a lawmaker.\n\nNew York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, tweeted a link to a news story of the separate bathrooms at the Providence office.Siri, show me what classism looks like: https://t.co/vUM7Fe7tJz\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) December 5, 2019 Siri, show me what classism looks like: https://t.co/vUM7Fe7tJz\n\"Siri, show me what classicism looks like,\" she wrote.\n\nIn September, California passed a bill that would extend new protections to employees of so-called \"gig economy\" companies including Lyft and Uber, essentially forcing companies to recognize formerly contract workers as employees.\n\nUber said at the time that the California bill, which is set to go into effect in January, \"does not automatically reclassify any rideshare drivers from independent contractors to employees\" and that it will \"respond to claims of misclassification in arbitration and in court as necessary.\" "}
