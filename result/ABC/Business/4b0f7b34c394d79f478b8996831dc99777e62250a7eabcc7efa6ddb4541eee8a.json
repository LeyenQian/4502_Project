Some Democrats believe DeVos intentionally stalled the program for more than a year while she rewrote the rules and made it more difficult for students to get loan relief.\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers had taken turns criticizing DeVos' handling of the program when it turned personal. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., said DeVos is the first political opponent she has encountered who is \u201cout to destroy public education.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you approach a public school, you are protested. When you enter, you are booed,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou are the most unpopular person in our government. Millions will register to vote in 2020. Many will vote to remove you more than to remove the president.\u201d\nDeVos did not immediately respond, but the remark drew quick condemnation from Republicans. Rep. Virginia Foxx, the ranking Republican, interrupted to call the comment \u201cabsolutely over the line,\u201d saying it would not have been allowed on the House floor. Another Republican tried unsuccessfully to get the remarks removed from the record.\nAfter the hearing, the Education Department issued a statement calling the hearing \u201ca cheap political show trial designed to personally attack and denigrate the Secretary of Education.\u201d\n\u201cIt was unprofessional, it was outside of the rules of the House, and it set a terrible example for America\u2019s young students who watched those shameless attacks. Our nation\u2019s elected leaders should do better,\u201d spokeswoman Angela Morabito said.\nAfter the chamber settled, lawmakers returned to the original topic and questioned DeVos for more than an hour more. Republicans applauded her work while Democrats blasted her handling of the program, which has become a central dispute in her ongoing feud with the party.\nThe program, known as borrower defense to repayment, is meant to forgive federal loans for students whose colleges misrepresent the quality of their education or otherwise commit fraud.\nIt was expanded under the Obama administration to help clear loans for thousands of students who attended Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit college chain that collapsed in 2015 amid allegations that it lied about the success of its graduates in order to get students to enroll.\nSoon after, thousands of additional claims were coming from students who attended other for-profit colleges, including defunct chains such as ITT Technical College. But after the Trump administration took office, the process ground to a halt. Loans were no longer being discharged, and a pool of 60,000 pending claims ballooned to more than 200,000.\nDemocrats have been seeking answers about the backlog for more than a year but say the Education Department has refused to cooperate. DeVos agreed last month to face the House education committee after Democrats threatened to issue a congressional subpoena forcing her appearance.\nAt the hearing, DeVos shifted much of the blame to the Obama administration. She said she inherited thousands of pending claims and no clear guidance on how to process them. Her predecessors had simply been approving all claims of fraud, she said, leaving it to her to devise a fair way to judge applications.\n\u201cYes, there is a backlog of borrower defense claims,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cTo say that I am frustrated by that is an understatement. But rather than focus on why there is a backlog, too many have instead focused on creating more chaos and a circus-like atmosphere.\u201d\nEarlier this week, DeVos unveiled a new method for judging claims that she says will help clear the backlog. It's meant to provide varying levels of loan forgiveness based on the degree of financial harm a student suffers.\nFull forgiveness will be granted only to students from programs that produce graduates with median incomes far below their peers in other similar programs. Other defrauded students can get 25% to 75% of their debt erased, depending on the median income of the program they attended.\nIt\u2019s a departure from the Obama administration, which provided full loan relief in all cases of fraud, and it drew outrage from Democrats, who said it\u2019s based on flawed statistical methods that will leave many cheated students repaying some portion of their loans.\n\u201cThose defrauded borrowers have been left with mountains of debt, worthless degrees and none of the job opportunities they were promised,\u201d Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., chairman of the House education committee, said Thursday. \u201cDefrauded borrowers have been cheated twice: First by their college, and then by a Department of Education that refuses to make them whole.\"\nDeVos said she disagrees with opponents who want to give \u201cblanket forgiveness for just anyone who raises their hand and files a claim.\u201d She said many applications are based on allegations so dubious that \u201cyour jaw would drop if you actually read\" the reasoning.\nRepublicans backed DeVos through the hearing, saying she\u2019s making sure taxpayers only cover students\u2019 college debt if they were actually financially harmed. Foxx said the accusations that DeVos purposefully delayed relief are unfair.\n\u201cSecretary DeVos is putting reforms in place that will help defrauded students navigate the process of getting the loan relief they deserve,\" Foxx said. \u201cCommittee Republicans are supportive of these efforts.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow Collin Binkley on Twitter at https://twitter.com/cbinkley"}
