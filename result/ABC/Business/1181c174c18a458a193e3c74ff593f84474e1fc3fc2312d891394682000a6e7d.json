Dr. Boris Paskhover of Rutgers New Jersey Medical School said his experience treating patients with cellphone injuries prompted him to look into the problem. \nPaskhover and others analyzed 20 years of emergency room data and found an increase in cellphone injuries starting after 2006, around the time when the first smartphones were introduced.\nSome injuries were caused by phones themselves, including people getting hit by a thrown phone. But Paskhover said many were caused by distracted use including texting while walking, tripping and landing face-down on the sidewalk. \nMost patients in the study weren\u2019t hospitalized, but the researchers said the problem should be taken seriously. \nThe study involved cases in a U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission database that collects emergency room visit information from about 100 hospitals. The researchers tallied 2,500 patients with cellphone-related head and neck injuries from 1998 through 2017. \nThe study was published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology.\nNationwide, they estimated there were about 76,000 people injured during that time. Annual cases totaled fewer than 2,000 until 2006, but increased steeply after that. About 40% of those injured were ages 13 to 29, and many were hurt while walking, texting or driving.\nCellphone use also has been linked with repetitive strain injuries in the hands and neck, and injuries to other parts of the body caused by distracted use. \n\u201cI love my smartphone,\u201d Paskhover said, but he added that it\u2019s easy to get too absorbed and avoiding injury requires common sense.\n\u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t walk around reading a magazine,\u201d he said. \u201cBe careful.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives         support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
