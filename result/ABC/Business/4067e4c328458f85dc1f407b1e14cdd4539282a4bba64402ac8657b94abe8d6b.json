The government announced then that Chinese importers were placing orders but no details of when the tariff exemption would take effect were released.\nChina is \u201ccarrying out the exclusion,\u201d the Ministry of Finance said on its website. The ministry and the Ministry of Commerce did not respond to requests for further information.\nNegotiators are working on the details of a \u201cPhase 1\u201d agreement announced in October by President Donald Trump.\nThe two sides have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods, disrupting global trade and threatening to depress economic growth.\nAnother U.S. tariff hike on an additional $160 billion of Chinese imports is due to take effect Dec. 15.\nChinese spokespeople have expressed hope for a settlement \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d but Trump spooked global financial markets this week by saying he might be willing to wait until after the U.S. presidential election late next year.\nA sticking point is Chinese insistence that Washington must roll back punitive tariffs as part of any deal.\nA Chinese spokesman repeated Thursday that Beijing expects such a move in a \u201cPhase 1\u201d agreement."}
