Gavin Newsom. \nThe opposition argued that         PG&E's $11 billion settlement with a group representing about 110 insurers that have already paid claims in the fires threatens to shortchange uninsured and underinsured victims. Critics also say the deal would give the company an unfair advantage to gain support for its deeply flawed reorganization plan.\nNancy Mitchell, an attorney, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali that PG&E\u2019s current rehabilitation plan doesn\u2019t meet the standards required to participate in a wildfire fund approved by California lawmakers last summer. Even so, Mitchell contended PG&E is hoping approval of the insurance settlement will give it the leverage to pressure voting stakeholders to approve its plan, which must happen by June 30 for the utility if it hopes to have future wildfire losses partially covered by the state's new fund.\n\u201cThey want to lock up the votes and then want to say, \u2018OK, state, you have no choice\u2019\u2019\u201d but to approve the plan, Mitchell said. Besides getting Montali's blessing, PG&E's plan also has to be approved by its chief regulator, the California Public Utilities Commission.\nPG&E lawyer Stephen Karotkin tried to assure Montali that the insurance settlement is the best way to fairly treat all the parties affected by the San Francisco company\u2019s 10-month-old bankruptcy case.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to take the risk that this thing blows up,\u201d Karotkin said.\nBoth PG&E and insurers have framed a settlement reached in September as a great deal because the $11 billion payment represents about 55 percent of the amount the carriers could seek if they sued the utility for the damages caused by its equipment and practices.i Insurers have paid out nearly $16 billion of the roughly $20 billion that they expect to cover in the fires linked to PG&E.\n\u201cIf this deal goes away, we are back to the drawing board,\u201d said Matthew Feldman, a lawyer for the insurers involved in the PG&E settlement.\nThe insurers have set a Friday deadline for getting court approval of the PG&E settlement, although Feldman told Montali that date could be extended if the judge needed more time to issue a ruling. Montali said he would try to issue a decision promptly.\nPG&E\u2019s proposed all-cash payment to the insurers has raised fears that the company won\u2019t have anywhere near enough money to cover all the other claims that have poured in from more than 70,000 victims in fires that erupted during the autumns of 2017 and 2018, killing more than 120 people and destroying nearly 28,000 homes and buildings. \nAttorneys for the fire victims are worried they could end up being forced to accept stock in a financially rehabilitated PG&E that could turn out to be horrible investment.\nAlthough it didn't come up in Wednesday's hearing, Newsom has been pressing PG&E to revise its plan to reserve $13.5 billion to cover fire victims beyond those included in the $11 billion settlement, matching the amount earmarked in the bondholders' competing proposal. PG&E's plan currently calls for the victims getting an additional $7.5 billion, not including government agencies with claims.\nNewsom may have gained more negotiating leverage with the         recent release of an exhaustive report from the California Public Utilities Commission that concluded PG&E repeatedly neglected to maintain a power line blamed for igniting a 2018 fire that nearly wiped out the city of Paradise.\nAlthough a state wildfire agency had already held PG&E responsible for that deadly blaze, the more extensive findings by the utility\u2019s main regulator could provide Newsom with more fodder to follow through on recent threats to mount a bid to turn the utility into a nonprofit cooperative owned by its customers\nMedia reports that PG&E was nearing an agreement to meet Newsom's demands caused the company's stock to surge 11% Wednesday to close at $9.47. That remains far below a high of $71.57 in September 2017, reached just before the first of the major wildfires erupted and began raising doubts about PG&E's future."}
