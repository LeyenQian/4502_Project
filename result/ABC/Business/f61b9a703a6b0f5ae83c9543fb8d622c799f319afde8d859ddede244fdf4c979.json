He had pleaded not guilty.\nProsecutors said Lischewski conspired with others in the industry to eliminate competition by setting prices for canned tuna from November 2010 until December 2013.\nLischewski's attorney, John Keker, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBumble Bee Foods itself agreed to pay a $25 million fine after pleading guilty to price fixing in 2017.\nLischewski supervised his subordinates\u2019 participation in the conspiracy, prosecutors said.\nIn September a federal judge ordered Pennsylvania-based StarKist Co. to pay a $100 million fine for its role in the collusion that also included Chicken of the Sea.\nStarKist last year agreed to plead guilty to a felony price-fixing charge.\nOne former StarKist executive and two from Bumble Bee also each pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges. All three testified at Lischewski\u2019s trial.\nThe scheme came to light when Thai Union Group's Chicken of the Sea attempt to buy San Diego-based Bumble Bee failed in 2015, according to court records.\nChicken of the Sea executives then alerted federal investigators, who agreed to shield the company from criminal prosecution in exchange for cooperation.\nThe three companies face lawsuits from wholesalers, food service companies and retailers."}
