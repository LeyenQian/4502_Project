South Korea\u2019s Kospi jumped 0.9% to 2,078.77, while the Shanghai Composite index was flat, at 2,899.97. Australia\u2019s S&P ASX 200 gained 0.2% to 6,697.40. Shares also rose in Taiwan and Southeast Asia.\nInvestors are hoping that the world\u2019s two biggest economies will reach a trade deal before new U.S. tariffs go into effect Dec. 15 on some popular products made in China, including smartphones.\n\u201cWhether or not U.S.-China can cut a deal remains the obsession; arguably the only game in town heading into ahead of the 15-Dec deadline for the next round of tariffs fall due,\u201d Mizuho Bank said in a commentary.\nChinese officials said Thursday that hinges on whether the U.S. will agree to roll back some of the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump after he began his effort to win trade concessions from Beijing in mid-2018.\n\u201cTo be sure, there is still no clarity on the deal. But soothing remarks on \u2018progress\u2019 from those involved in the talks appears to have infused some hope and cut tensions,\u201d the Mizuho report said.\nInvestors will be looking for clues into the state of the U.S. economy from the Labor Department\u2019s November tally of hiring by nonfarm employers, to be released later Friday. Economists expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.6%.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had some mixed economic data this week, so the market probably wants to wait and see what we get tomorrow morning,\u201d said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird.\nThe S&P 500 index rose 0.2% to 3,117.43.

The indexes rebounded Wednesday on a report that Washington and Beijing could be on track for a trade deal before the new tariffs kick in next week.\nTechnology stocks were among the biggest gainers Thursday. Apple rose 1.5%. The sector has much to gain, or lose, in trade negotiations because many of the companies rely heavily on China for sales and supplies.\nCommunication services stocks also rose. ViacomCBS led the sector, climbing 3.6%. It was the first day of trading for the newly combined company.\nUnited Airlines slipped 0.4% after it said CEO Oscar Munoz is stepping down from his post and will become executive chairman. The airline said that President J. Scott Kirby will be its new CEO.\nMunoz led the company through a choppy period, and in 2017 gave up his bonus after the forcible removal of a ticketed passenger led to widespread criticism.\nBenchmark crude oil lost 21 cents to $58.22 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
