{"Title": "Season\u2019s greetings at Sears: Dingy shops, sparse shelves", "Link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/seasons-sears-dingy-shops-sparse-shelves-67493739", "Article": "\nNearly 10 months out of bankruptcy, Sears is limping into the holiday shopping season.\nEddie Lampert, the hedge fund billionaire         who promised to save 425 Sears and Kmart stores and roughly 45,000 jobs when he bought the company out of bankruptcy, has seen his $5.2 billion lifeline wither. \nWhile there were plans for new small stores centered on appliances, only three have opened. The chain is still shrinking. By February, the store count will be down to 182.\nMany of the stores that remain have the same old problems. They\u2019re grungy and understaffed, poorly stocked and losing vendors. At the end of the year \u2014 a crucial time for retailers \u2014 Sears\u2019 threadbare Black Friday catalog signals it\u2019s going to have problems getting shoppers to its doors. And online, it can\u2019t compete with Amazon and its traditional rivals.\n\u201cThey used to be top of mind, particularly during this time of year,\u201d said Coye Nokes, a partner at OC & C Strategy Consultants. \u201cNow, they\u2019ve faded into the landscape. They\u2019ve become irrelevant.\u201d\nThe ever-shrinking Sears means more job losses. Thousands of jobs are gone, although Sears\u2019 owner through a spokesman declined to say how many since Lampert bought the company out of bankruptcy in February. There are fewer choices for shoppers and suppliers. It also puts more pressure on malls, which must figure out how to fill the gaping holes left by Sears.\nLampert\u2019s failure comes as no surprise to industry experts. He was the only buyer who offered Sears a lifeline at all \u2014 other bidders just wanted to liquidate the chain \u2014 but he had already presided over a long decline of Sears going back more than a decade.\nThe signs at Sears are ominous heading into the holidays, when retailers acquire new customers.\nBlack Friday was bleak at its store in Jersey City, New Jersey, where an unplugged Christmas tree sat on top of a round table by the entrance. Few shoppers were in the store and the toy section had no Legos or Hatchimals, even though signs indicated they would be there.\nA store needs to have stuff on its shelves to attract customers, and Sears is having issues with some suppliers cutting it off. One vendor, Stolaas, has stopped selling refurbished Apple gadgets on Sears\u2019 website because it wasn\u2019t getting paid, said David Wander, a bankruptcy attorney at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron who represents Stolaas.\nThe supplier issue is showing up in Sears\u2019 advertising. Its revised circular for Black Friday had eight pages of deals, less than a quarter of the size last year, according to Edgar Dworsky, founder and editor of Boston-based consumer advocacy website Consumer World. None were for major electronics \u2014 one of the reasons people used to go to Sears.\nLands\u2019 End, a clothing brand that was once a big draw when Sears purchased it in 2002 but was spun off in 2014, is nearing the end of its remaining leases, due to expire next month. Now, Lands\u2019 End clothing is on clearance, and Sears was even selling its mannequins at the Jersey City store for $75, with an additional 60% Black Friday discount. Empty paint cans were marked down to $2 each with the discount.\nPeter Doliente  bought himself a Seiko watch at the store for $200, down from $500.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much customers around,\u201d the teacher from Jersey City said. \u201cI was surprised when I went to the parking lot. Normally it would be packed at this time.\u201d\nSears once towered over the retail landscape but has been on a slow decline for years. Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, pledging to return Sears to greatness. That didn\u2019t happen. Sears was hit hard during the recession a decade ago and never recovered.\nSelling well-known brands, like its Craftsman tools, and spinning off stores were cash infusions that helped Sears survive. Lampert lent some money of his own, but critics say he never invested in the stores, which grew increasingly dingy.\nEven after all of Sears\u2019 pain, Lampert argued during its bankruptcy that he was its best chance. Industry experts remain skeptical of his ability to revive Sears, saying he is still neglecting stores. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think this was a surprise to anyone,\u201d said Scott Stuart, CEO of Turnaround Management Association, whose members include corporate turnaround experts and store liquidators. \u201cIt was more a surprise that (Lampert) publicly determined that this was something salvageable.\u201d\nIn a statement, Transform Holdco, the owner of Sears managed by Lampert, said that it \u201cfaced a difficult retail environment and other challenges\u201d and it\u2019s working to \u201cprune its operations.\u201d The company said in November that it got another $250 million in financing.\nThat\u2019s no solace to employees like Victor Urquidez, the assistant manager at a Sears Auto Center in Chula Vista, California, who said he will be losing his job when the store closes in late December.\n\u201cWe were expecting it,\u201d said Urquidez, who has watched deliveries shrink from 100 tires at a time two years ago to nine today. \u201cWe knew it was going to happen.\u201d\nWhat comes next for Sears? There\u2019s little optimism. While there are plenty of vendors still sending in goods, the rescue plan has barely begun and shoppers simply have far better options elsewhere.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dead man walking,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consultancy. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that next Christmas, Sears won\u2019t be around as currently structured.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAP Retail Writer Joseph Pisani in New Jersey contributed to this report.\n----------\nFollow Anne D\u2019Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio\n----------\nThis story has been corrected to show the watch buyer is Peter Doliente, not Dolente, and the CEO of Turnaround Management Association is Scott Stuart, not Stewart, and the store count by February will be 182, not 128."}
