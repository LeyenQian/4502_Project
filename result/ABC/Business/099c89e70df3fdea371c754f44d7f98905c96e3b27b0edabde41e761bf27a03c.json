It poses major concerns to certain member states, in particular Greece and Cyprus,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters after chairing a meeting of the bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels.\nGreece, Cyprus, and Egypt, which lie between Turkey and Libya geographically, have blasted the accord as being contrary to international law.\nBorrell declined to say that the agreement breaks the law, but he said that \"we are going to be studying this question very closely, being clear that any agreement must respect international law.\u201d\nSome of Greece and Cyprus's partners were unequivocal.\n\u201cThe Netherlands is always a staunch supporter of the rule of international law, and we side with Greece,\" said Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok. \"International law should be upheld.\u201d\nAustrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said \u201cit\u2019s a little bit astounding how they split up the Mediterranean among themselves. We\u2019ll have to see how we deal with it.\u201d\nAlthough they are NATO allies, neighbors Greece and Turkey are divided by a series of decades-old rows, including territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, and have come to the brink of war three times since the 1970s, including once over drilling rights in the Aegean.\nIn Cairo, parliament speaker Ali Abdel-Al warned that \u201cEgypt will not stand idle by while a foreign country is threatening its interests,\" according to the official MENA news agency.\n\u201cAnyone who approaches the maritime, air, and land borders of Egypt should review himself. We will not accept or allow any mess at or close to our borders,\" he was quoted as saying, in reference to Turkey.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nElena Becatoros in Athens, Menelaos Hadjicostis in Nicosia and Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed to this report."}
