Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, and other officials then left the meeting without announcing any deal.\nOPEC\u2019s members have been expected to prolong production cuts that they agreed on for the past three years, while Russia\u2019s energy minister said that even deeper cuts were under discussion. The price of crude has been held down in recent years by a resurgence in supplies from countries outside OPEC, particularly the United States.\nAs it stands, OPEC nations have agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day through March. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, whose country is not part of OPEC but joins part of the meeting to coordinate production, said Thursday that the group was discussing a further cut of 500,000 barrels a day \u201cin order to safely go through the seasonal demand trough in the first quarter 2020.\u201d\nOPEC officials were to broaden discussions to include non-OPEC members on Friday.\nSaudi Arabia is bearing the burden of the largest share of OPEC\u2019s production cuts. But some member countries such as Iraq have been breaching the agreement and producing more than their allotted amount.\nAnalysts note that if countries are already not complying with the current agreement, voting for more cuts could be pointless.\n\u201cI think the Saudi position is they\u2019re willing to cut more if needed, but they want better compliance,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, executive director of global oil at research group IHS Markit.\nBrent crude oil hovered near $63 per barrel Thursday. Prices have fluctuated throughout the year, reaching nearly $75 in April after U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela limited world supply, but lingering trade tensions between the U.S. and China dampened economic expectations pushed prices back down.\nWest Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, was trading above $58.\nRussia has indicated it wants its oil production re-calculated to exclude gas condensate, a liquid byproduct of natural gas production. Condensate is counted against production totals for non-OPEC members but not for members.\nEven if members of the cartel cut production, there is more oil coming to market from non-OPEC nations, including the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Norway and Guyana, which will more than make up for any drop in production, according to IHS Markit.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press writer Kiyoko Metzler reported this story in Vienna and AP writer David McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.
