The stores have survived the devastation the independent book business suffered after Amazon.com began selling books online and at lower prices in 1995. \nBut Mulvihill still faces challenges. He's taken on this latest store because of economies of scale \u2014 it's cheaper to spread administrative costs across three stores instead of two. Like other booksellers, he's had to change the merchandise he stocks to keep customers coming in and buying even though they can get books cheaper \u2014 for example, on Amazon. Although books are his primary items, as much as 15% of sales come from what's known as non-book merchandise including gifts, music, games, cards, apparel. He also sells used and rare books. \nA variety of merchandise is particularly necessary during the holidays, when, Mulvilhill says, \u201cthere are only so many books that will sell. People come in and they want to buy their uncle a puzzle.\u201d\nWhile book retailers like Mulvihill are cautious, statistics from the American Booksellers Association, a trade group for independent booksellers, show a recovery from the industry's darkest days. The ABA had 1,887 member companies as of May 15, up nearly 35% from 1,401 in 2009. The number of members' stores totaled 2,524 in May, up more than half from 1,651. Another sign of improving health: the number of books indies have sold. Book sales rose 5% in 2018 from 2017, and in 2017 they were up 2.6% from 2016.\nIndependent sellers are doing better even as Amazon continues to thrive online and to open its own stores, so far mostly in big metropolitan areas. Amazon does not break out how much revenue it takes in from books. Barnes & Noble, which has been struggling as Amazon continues growing, also does not break out book revenue.\nIndies are doing better partly because customers feel a deep connection, even affection, for the shops where they can find kindred spirits in owners and staffers, and where they can touch and leaf through the books. Social media, which helps bookstores build and nurture those relationships, also helps sales, says Dan Cullen, senior strategy officer at the ABA. \nSo does the growing \u201cshop local\u201d movement. \u201cLiterally millions of consumers are deciding to spend a certain amount of their discretionary income on locally owned stores,\u201d Cullen says.\nThe indies are also helped by the fact more people are reading printed books rather than electronic versions \u2014 sales of e-books fell 37% between 2014 and 2018, according to the Association of American Publishers, an industry group.\nStill, independent book selling remains a low-margin and challenging business. Owners who sell toys and gifts do so because those items are more profitable than books; there's more price flexibility with non-book merchandise because publishers print the maximum price on dust jackets. Some shops have installed cafes, making their stores more inviting. These features became popular with the growth of the now-defunct Borders chain, and Barnes & Noble includes them in its stores.\n\u201cThe way to get people to go to stores is to give them an experience, something they can't get online,\" says Tom Meyvis, a marketing professor at New York University's Stern School of Business whose work focuses on consumer behavior. \"People want to spend some time browsing in stores and with books, this is one of the more agreeable shopping experiences.\nBut Christine Onorati, who has WORD bookstores in Brooklyn, New York, and Jersey City, New Jersey, and has tried these strategies, worries about indies' ability to sustain their growth. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to the point where flat is great,\" she says. \u201cIf you can stay flat, you\u2019re hanging on and you\u2019re doing OK.\" \nAnd bookstores still shut down, especially if rents are so high an owner can't even break even or if changing demographics mean a neighborhood can't support a store. Labor costs are also a challenge in states and cities where the minimum wage is rising.\n\u2018\u2019It essentially comes down to more than anything, rising payroll costs, but also costs like rent and administrative costs,\" says Bradley Graham, who has owned Politics and Prose in Washington, D.C., for nearly nine of its 35 years. In Washington, the minimum wage, which was $12.50 in 2017, has gone up 75 cents each year and is now $14; it rises to $15 July 1. The city also has laws requiring companies to give workers paid sick, medical and family leave.\nBut, Onorati says, \u201cthe good news is, when customers walk into the store, there\u2019s an unwritten understanding they could buy cheaper else. They say, \u2018I\u2019 in here because I want to be here.\" \nThe human touch that small bookstores offer draws people in, says Chris Morrow, co-owner of Northshire Bookstore in Manchester Center, Vermont, and Saratoga Springs, New York. \n\u201c\u00cft's our ability to listen well and ask questions and connect people with the right book at the right time,\" he says. For example, someone who has suffered a loss and is looking for a book on grieving.\nSome indies persevere partly because they have legendary status well beyond the cities and towns where they're located. Politics and Prose is one, and others include Denver's Tattered Cover and BookPeople in Austin, Texas. A location in a college or university town or a tourism area can boost sales.\nWaucoma Bookstore in Hood River, Oregon, gets steady business from people visiting the Columbia River Gorge and the Cascade mountains.\n\u201cWe definitely have tourists who come in for the bookstore experience,\u201d co-owner Jenny Cohen says. \u201cA lot of them have commented that they like the shop because they no longer have a bookstore in their community.\"\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at         www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg.
