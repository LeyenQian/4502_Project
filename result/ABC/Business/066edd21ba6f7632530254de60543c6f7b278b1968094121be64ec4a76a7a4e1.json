All metro lines bar two were closed and many train routes remained canceled as unions dig in their heels against President Emmanuel Macron, who they accuse of shaping policies in favor of the rich.\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe detailed the pension reforms in a speech on Wednesday, saying bluntly that the French \u201cwill need to work longer.\u201d\nIt was rich in detail. People born after 1974 will have to work until the age of 64 to get a full pension, instead of 62 previously. Those born before that date will not be affected in any way, he said, throwing out a sweetener. \nThe leader of the prominent CGT workers' union, Philippe Martinez, flatly rejected the new plans.\n\u201cThe government is making fun of everyone,\u201d he said. Several other unions including Workers' Force, said the prime minister's address only \u201cconfirms the necessity to step up the strike action.\u201d\nThe new scheme is aimed at replacing a complicated pension system that included dozens of special privileges for some sectors, like public transport, with one set of rules for all.\nPhilippe said the changes would ensure the pension system is \u201cfair and sustainable\" in the face of a growing population with, a record number of people over 90. \nFor people entering the workforce, the reforms will only start to apply in 2022, which happens to be the last year of Macron's term. The government also introduced the country's first ever minimum pension, which will be available to those who worked their whole life, at a relatively high 1,000 euros ($1,100) per month. That compares with 858 euros (723 pounds) a month in the U.K. \nBeginning under Macron's watch, it will be harder for the law to be undone by a successive president but late enough in his mandate to avert protracted political harm.\nThe plans though seem to have done little to abate the strikes that were billed as \u201cunlimited\u201d and threatened to mirror similar ones in 1995 that caused the ousting of Prime Minister Alain Juppe. That action paralyzed the country with widespread public support and were themselves compared to the events of May 1968, when France reached the brink of revolution.\nMany French people and the unions leading the strikes fear the new system will force people to work longer for smaller pension allocations. \nAmid all the political speeches, the strikes continue to cripple the eurozone's second-largest economy and the mood among the public remains strained but understanding."}
