Last year\u2019s ruined crop spilled from metal storage bins that burst nine months ago when the Missouri River surged through two levees near his southwest Iowa farm.\nLike many in the water-weary Midwest, Walter doesn\u2019t know if climate change was responsible for the second major flood in nine years. Or the increasingly frequent torrential rains that dump more water in an hour than he used to see in days.\nEven so, \u201cwe kind of feel like it\u2019s the new normal,\u201d said Walter, who lost 46,000 bushels of corn and soybeans. \u201cYou can\u2019t rely on anything. You can\u2019t build anything. You can\u2019t do future planning ... the uncertainty is the thing that is really bad.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s devastating losses are forcing tough decisions about the future of farming in America\u2019s flood plains, even among those skeptical of climate change and humans\u2019 role in it.\nFarmers who lost billions of dollars in grain, livestock, equipment, structures and unplanted crops are wondering whether they should \u2014 or can \u2014 return to the fertile bottomlands next year.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must determine how many damaged levees can be rebuilt but says it won\u2019t be all of them. More than 50 levees were breached on the Missouri River alone, taking thousands of acres out of production.\nAnd with the ground still soggy heading into winter, experts say the stage is set for more flooding next spring.\n\u201cA lot of this ground won\u2019t be put back into production,\u201d said Brett Adams, a Peru, Nebraska, farmer who saw 2,000 acres (809 hectares) \u2014 80% of his land \u2014 submerged in up to 12 feet (3.7 meters) of water. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it first-hand up and down the river \u2014 land is so tore up from flooding that some of it is completely ruined.\u201d\nAdams lost over 100,000 bushels of corn and a half million dollars in potential income after six storage bins burst. But he bristles when people ask why he farms in an area that could flood.\n\u201cBecause it never flooded before,\u201d Adams tells them, noting that a levee built in 1950 kept his farm dry during major floods in 1993 and 2011.\nIt\u2019s very difficult to directly tie this year\u2019s flooding \u2014 or any single weather event \u2014 to climate change. But the flooding comes as \u201cwe\u2019re seeing big rain and even bigger snows that are consistent with what we will see in a warming world,\u201d because a warmer atmosphere delivers more water to storm systems, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt.\nThe number of heavy rain events has increased throughout much of the U.S., including the Midwest, where the days with at least one inch of rain averaged 13% higher from 2009 to 2018 than the long-term average dating to 1950, according to NOAA. \nIn Missouri, the number of annual 4-inch (10.2-centimeter) or greater rainfalls was 58% higher than the long-term average. In Iowa, the increase was 31% and in Nebraska it was 23%.\nThere also will be more severe droughts, experts say, while rains will be more intense, with more water falling in a shorter period. What's more, the greatest increase in rainfall is occurring in the fall, when farmers are trying to harvest.\nThe unpredictability \u201cends up being really bad news for farms,\u201d said Jeffrey S. Dukes, an ecologist who directs the Climate Change Research Center at Purdue University.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nHeavy rains and flooding kept farmers from their fields in more than a dozen states this year, the wettest on record through October in the contiguous U.S., and breached levees along major waterways that included the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers.\nOn the Missouri, the         disaster unfolded after a blizzard was followed by heavy rain that fell on the snow and frozen ground. Most of the runoff came from tributaries without levees or dams, so the Army Corps had no way to slow the surge and little time to warn farmers.\n\u201cIt just completely overwhelmed the levees downstream,\u201d said Matthew Krajewski, chief of the readiness branch in the Corps\u2019 Omaha District.\nExperts say heavy rain in 2018 set the stage for the floods because the soil was saturated as winter started.\nNow         the situation is worse than this time last year because heavy rain fell all summer and into the fall, preventing the soil from drying out, said Kevin Low, a hydrologist at the Missouri Basin River Forecast Center.\n\u201cThe setup is extremely bad,\u201d he said, noting most levees have not been repaired. \u201cThere is nothing we can do but watch and wait.\u201d\nSome areas along the Missouri were above flood stage more than 270 consecutive days, according to hydrologist David Pearson at the National Weather Service\u2019s Missouri Basin River Forecast Center.\nJulius Schaaf believes it\u2019s the Army Corps\u2019 job to protect farmland like his, though he concedes there is a legitimate question whether farmers should remove structures from flood plains.\n\u201cThe levees and dams ... kind of gave us a false sense of security,\u201d said Schaaf, whose farms near Randolph, Iowa were flooded this year. \u201cWe went ahead and made an investment because the government said, \u2018We\u2019ve got this river tamed and you folks are good.\u2019\u201d\nBut the Corps says its priority is to protect people and infrastructure such as highways, railroads and towns \u2014 not agricultural land.\nThe agency is conducting cost-benefit assessments to determine which levees can and should be rebuilt. \u201cThere is a good chance\u201d that it won\u2019t be all of them, said the Corps\u2019 Krajewski, noting that funding is limited.\nSome farmland along the Missouri could be flooded for years awaiting repairs and would have to be cleared of silt and debris before being planted again.\nThe decision to abandon farmland is complicated by that fact that catastrophic floods are unpredictable, said Ken Kunkel, a NOAA researcher.\n\u201dBut it seems to me, like in lot of situations when you\u2019re in a flood plain, expecting to be completely protected by anything probably is unwise and becoming unwiser as time goes on,\u201d Kunkel said.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSome experts say U.S. agriculture policy discourages farmers from adopting practices that could help reduce losses to extreme weather.\nConservation programs that pay farmers to set aside land, including in flood plains, are underfunded, experts say. The taxpayer-subsidized crop insurance program effectively discourages farmers from planting more than a couple of crops and gives them an incentive to plant on risky land because some losses would be recouped.\nIt\u2019s also easier to obtain loans for certain crops, such as corn, wheat and soybeans in the Midwest, said Ben Lilliston, rural strategies and climate change director at the Minnesota-based Institute for Agriculture & Trade Policy. That makes it difficult for farmers to rotate several crops, which preserves soil health and helps weather floods and drought.\nAfter a crippling year, many farmers will need to return to low-lying fields if they can.\nWalter, the Iowa farmer, considered abandoning 750 acres (304 hectares) of bottomlands, but it was a huge chunk of the 1,200 acres (486 hectares) he farms with his son.\nSo they\u2019ll continue farming it once the levees are repaired, he said.\nBut farmers need to ask themselves if the risk of farming in flood plains is worth the reward, said Dukes, the Purdue ecologist.\n\u201cIs it worth the great yields you might get in great years versus the total loss in other years?\u201d he said. \u201cDo taxpayers want to be subsidizing the losses?\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWebber reported from Chicago.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nRead more stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at         https://www.apnews.com/Climate     \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow Webber and Funk on Twitter:         https://twitter.com/twebber02          https://twitter.com/Funkwrite     "}
