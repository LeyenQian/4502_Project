Proportional funds are really are what are going to be needed for that task.\u201d\nWhile participating in the climate conference known as COP25, Salles is working to assure others of the environmental policies of Brazil's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.\nBolsonaro has squabbled with some European leaders this year over his commitment to protecting the Amazon. He has worried environmental activists and others by criticizing Brazil's environment regulator and by calling for more development in the Amazon region. He also accused activists groups, without evidence, of having set fires in that region to undermine his administration. \nDeforestation in the 12 months through July reached the highest annual rate in 11 years. Brazil\u2019s annual deforestation report released in November showed a nearly 30% jump from the prior year in the Amazon, which lost 3,769 square miles (9,760 square kilometers) of forest.\nSalles said developed nations should help Brazil on the basis of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement signed in 2015 on tackling the effects of climate change. The article says monetary compensation mechanisms must be created to help developing countries.\nBrazil already receives money from wealthy nations, namely Germany and Norway, to fight deforestation in the vast Amazon rainforest. Norway alone has donated $1.2 billion to Brazil\u2019s Amazon Fund since its creation in 2008.\nHowever, both European nations have suspended contributions, citing the continued deforestation and questioning whether the government wants to stop it. The Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported this past week that the fund's disbursements this year were the smallest since 2013 and said zero projects were approved despite the fact the fund has 2.2 billion reais ($530 million) available.\nSalles in the past has questioned the fund\u2019s effectiveness. He said in the interview that Brazil is negotiating with the two European countries to restart the program. He said they exchanged draft documents, and he expects them to meet next week to discuss new terms of the fund.\nBrazil now has \u201can appropriate approach on the problem of deforestation,'' Salles said.\nHe said the government is putting a new emphasis on balancing protection with efforts to develop biological resources that can provide livings for people in the Amazon region.\n\u201cIf we don't solve the economic development for more than 20 million Brazilians who live there and people who need to have this sustainable, from both a financial and environmental perspective, they will be easily co-opted by illegal activities,\u201d Salles said. \u201cIt is a huge effort to attract the private sector to participate.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMarcelo De Sousa reported from Rio de Janeiro."}
