The EU\u2019s new executive Commission is expected to present its long-term plan for tackling global warming \u2014 dubbed the European Green Deal \u2014 next week.\nEnvironmental campaigners said the EU should step up its efforts to ensure that the aim of the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century remains possible.\n\u201cCurrent EU leaders are the last generation that can prevent the climate breakdown,\u201d said Wendel Trio, director of the campaign group Climate Action Network Europe.\nTrio noted that the European Parliament recently declared a symbolic \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d\n\u201cCitizens want them to act now, and not in 30 years,\u201d he said.\nThe European Environment Agency report said that \u201cthere is still a chance to meet the longer-term goals and objectives for 2030 and 2050\u201d if countries ratchet up their efforts, adding that this will require tackling politically sensitive issues such as fossil fuel subsidies.\nA         separate study published Wednesday by a group of international scientists found that both the European Union and the United States saw emissions drop 1.7% from 2018 to 2019, but China saw a 2.6% increase and India had a 1.8% rise.\nSwedish activist Greta Thunberg said the study showed that \u201cinstead of the drastic reductions desperately needed, our CO2 emissions keep increasing.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re still moving fast in the wrong direction,\u201d Thunberg said in a tweet. Thunberg is expected to         travel to Madrid for a mass protest on Friday outside the climate talks.\nUnder the slogan \u201cThe world has awakened to the climate emergency,\u201d the rally is expected to gather \u201cat least 100,000\u201d protesters from all over the world, including representatives of Latin America\u2019s indigenous people at the front of it, activists said on Wednesday.\nSmall-scale protests of barely dozens of activists have been taking place almost daily since the summit began. On Wednesday, some 40 Extinction Rebellion activists broke into a fashion store in a major shopping thoroughfare, gluing their hands to the windows to protest the impact of the garment industry on the environment.\nPolice removed the protesters, who carried signs reading \u201cThe Earth pays for fast fashion\u201d and \u201cGreen words, toxic truths.\u201d One of them was arrested for disobeying police orders.\n\u201c2019 has been the year of the awakening of civil society and the youth who have stood up to urge politicians and business heavyweights for more ambition against the climate emergency,\u201d said Pablo Chamorro, a spokesman for March for Climate, one of the hundreds of social justice and environmental groups signing the manifesto for Friday\u2019s scheduled march.\nThe march has been hastily organized in Madrid after the U.N. climate talks moved to the Spanish capital from protest-hit Chile. Activists will also hold a march on the same day in the Chilean capital of Santiago.\nNGOs and activist groups will also hold from Dec. 7 until the end of the summit, on Dec. 13, a \u201cSocial Summit\u201d at a university in Madrid to push for greater and fairer action against global warming. The alternative summit mirrors a similar gathering in Chile where activists want to provide a platform for unofficial voices.\n\u201cClimate change has been hijacked by a technical language that seemed not to leave space for normal people to have a voice,\u201d said Estefan\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, a Chilean activist also behind Friday\u2019s march.\n\u201cI wish there are more people like Greta taking over the microphones and not allowing the same people to keep monopolizing the climate message,\u201d she added.\nPope Francis, who has made caring for the environment a hallmark of his papacy, also waded into the debate by sending a message to the Madrid talks questioning if there\u2019s the \u201cfar-sighted\u201d political will to deal with climate change.\nClimate change is a \u201cchallenge of civilization,\u201d said Francis in the Dec. 1 message made public by The Vatican on Wednesday. He added that, \u201csadly,\u201d awareness is still weak about the need to work harder for \u201cour common home.\u201d\nIn the message, Francis says that what\u2019s needed is \u201cclear, far-sighted and strong political will.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nJordans reported from Berlin.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow AP's climate coverage at         https://www.apnews.com/Climate     \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
