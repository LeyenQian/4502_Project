Officials did not respond to requests for more details.\nCritics are already raising objections.\nSen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said Tuesday he will introduce legislation to block the plan and prohibit U.S. citizens from being forced to provide facial-recognition information. He said a recent data breach at Customs and Border Protection shows that Homeland Security can\u2019t be trusted with the information.\nFacial recognition is being tested by several airlines at a number of U.S. airports. American citizens are allowed to opt out of being photographed, although a 2017 audit by a federal watchdog agency found that few U.S. travelers exercised that right \u2014 barely more than one per flight.\nFederal law requires Homeland Security to put into place a system to use biometrics to confirm the identity of international travelers. Government officials have made no secret of their desire to expand the use of biometrics, which they say could identify potential terrorists and prevent fraudulent use of travel documents.\nHomeland Security announced the possibility of expanding biometrics to U.S. citizens in a recent, brief filing. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of Homeland Security, said there would be a chance for the public to comment on any change in regulations.\nIn a November 2018 report, Homeland Security said facial recognition is the best biometric approach at borders because it can be done quickly and \u201cwith a high degree of accuracy.\u201d The agency said privacy risks \u201care mostly mitigated.\u201d Photos used to match Americans to their identities are deleted within 12 hours, according to the report.\nJay Stanley, a policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the government has told the public and Congress repeatedly that American citizens would be exempt from mandatory biometric screening.\n\u201cThis new notice suggests that the government is reneging on what was already an insufficient promise,\u201d Stanley said in a statement. \"Travelers, including U.S. citizens, should not have to submit to invasive biometric scans simply as a condition of exercising their constitutional right to travel.\u201d"}
