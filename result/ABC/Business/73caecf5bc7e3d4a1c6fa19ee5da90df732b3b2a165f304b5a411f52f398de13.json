The rule announced Wednesday is one of three proposals for cutting the food stamp program.\nBrandon Lipps, deputy under secretary for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Nutrition and Consumer Services, said tightening the work requirement would save roughly $5.5 billion over five years. It would also cut benefits for roughly 688,000 SNAP recipients.\nSecretary Sonny Perdue said the rule will help move people \u201cfrom welfare to work.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to encourage people by giving them a helping hand, but not an infinitely giving hand,\u201d he said.\nRep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, called the rule \u201can unacceptable escalation of the administration\u2019s war on working families.\u201d\n\u201cThe President has cynically weaponized USDA as a blunt political instrument, in clear opposition to its mission to \u2018do right and feed everyone,\u2019\u201d said Fudge, who chairs the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations.\nUnder current rules, work-eligible able-bodied adults without dependents and between the ages of 18 and 49 can currently receive only three months of SNAP benefits in a three-year period if they don\u2019t meet the 20-hour work requirement. But states with high unemployment rates or a demonstrable lack of sufficient jobs can waive those time limits.\nThe new rule imposes stricter criteria that states must meet in order to issue waivers.\nThe new plan will strip states\u2019 ability to issue waivers unless a city or county has an unemployment rate of 6% or higher. The waivers will be good for one year and will require the governor to support the request.\nThe final rule will be published in the federal register Thursday, and go into effect in April.\nOver the past year         USDA has proposed changes to other areas of the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program.  USDA also has proposed eliminating broad-based categorical eligibility for food stamps, a measure that allows recipients of certain non-cash public benefits to automatically qualify for food stamps. And in October, the administration proposed changing how utility costs are factored into benefit calculations.\nLipps said the USDA is currently reviewing comments received during public comment period for the other two proposal, but did not say when the department will finalize them.\nThe Urban Institute in a study released last month estimated that taken together, the three measures would affect roughly 2.2 million households, and 3.7 million individual beneficiaries.\nPresident Donald Trump supported House Republicans in their efforts to include stricter work requirements for food stamp recipients in last year\u2019s farm bill. Those provisions were ultimately stripped from the final bill."}
