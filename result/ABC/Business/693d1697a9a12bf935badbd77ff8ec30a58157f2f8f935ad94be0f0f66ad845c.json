The central bank's key rate influences many consumer and business loans.\nHOLIDAY SEASON BOOST?\nNew data on U.S. retail sales will provide another view of how the holiday shopping season is going.\nEconomists predict the Commerce Department will report Friday that retail sales rose 0.4% in November.
