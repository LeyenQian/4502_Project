Laurer,  whose invention of the Universal Product Code at IBM transformed retail and other industries around the world, has died. He was 94.\nA funeral was held on Monday for Laurer, who died Thursday at his home in Wendell, North Carolina, a suburb of Raleigh. Sean Bannon with Strickland Funeral Home in Wendell said he had no information on Laurer's cause of death.\nLaurer was an electrical engineer with IBM in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park in the early 1970s when he spearheaded the development of t he UPC, or bar code.\nThe now-ubiquitous marking, composed of unique black bars and a 12-digit number, allowed retailers to identify products and their prices as they are scanned, usually at checkout. \nLaurer said in a 2010 interview that grocery stores in the 1970s were dealing with soaring costs and the labor-intensive requirements of putting price tags on all of their products. The bar code led to fewer pricing errors and allowed retailers to keep better account of their inventory. \nToday, such UPCs are on all kinds of products, services and other items for identification.\n\u201cTo me, it's just absolutely amazing, because when we were doing this ... I never expected it to be anything like this,\" Laurer told WRAL-TV in 2010. He later produced a patent for one of the first hand-held scanners for reading bar codes, according to an obituary provided by the funeral home. \nA New York native, Laurer served in the Army during World War II and graduated from the University of Maryland in 1951, after which he worked for IBM for over three decades. IBM identified him during the company's 2011         centennial celebration as a contributor to one of the company's 100 iconic moments.\nLaurer told WRAL he was still in awe of the invention, which was celebrated on its 25th anniversary at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. \n\u201c When I watch these clerks zipping the stuff across the scanners and I keep thinking to myself ... ' It  can't work that well,'\u201d he said. \nHe was preceded in death by his wife, Marilyn Slocum Laurer. Survivors include four children, as well as several grandchildren and great-grandchildren."}
