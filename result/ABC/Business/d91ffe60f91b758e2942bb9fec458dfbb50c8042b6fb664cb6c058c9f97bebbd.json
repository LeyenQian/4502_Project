Her plan did not come with any legislation, but instead she called on members of Congress to discuss her proposal.\nThe proposal was met with skepticism by some in Congress, including Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor.\n\u201cThe Federal Student Aid office should already be putting students at the center of its work and should already be free from political whims,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThe department should focus its time and resources on implementing the existing student loan programs in good faith. There\u2019s nothing that could be done with a new agency that can\u2019t be done today.\u201d\nIn her remarks, DeVos said a separate FSA \"would do all the things it\u2019s been charged to do \u2014 only far better.\u201d\nShe has long argued that the government plays an outsized role in student lending, often describing it as a \u201cgovernment monopoly\u201d that has become costly to taxpayers and students alike.\nShe has criticized the Obama administration for taking over federal loans that were previously provided by private banks, saying it fueled higher levels of borrowing and gave schools incentive to raise tuition rates.\nAt the same time, DeVos says Congress has created a confusing web of programs that students struggle to navigate as they borrow loans, pay them back or pursue programs that provide debt forgiveness.\n\u201cJust look at today\u2019s parade of repayment options, forgiveness plans, unlimited lending, and complex rules,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cIs it any wonder students are having bad experiences?\u201d\nDeVos is proposing a radical shift in strategy at the same time that Democrats in Congress are ramping up scrutiny of her handling of multiple federal loan programs.\nThe House\u2019s education committee has threatened to subpoena DeVos to determine why her agency has stopped processing loan forgiveness claims from students who say they were defrauded by their schools.\nShe faces similar scrutiny amid findings that the Education Department has rejected the vast majority of applications for the federal government\u2019s Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\nDeVos denies wrongdoing and blames Congress for creating programs with overly complex rules. She revived that criticism Tuesday before calling on Congress to cooperate with her proposal.\n\u201cPresident Trump and this administration are committed to transforming Federal Student Aid for students,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cCongress needs to come alongside us to make this happen.\u201d"}
