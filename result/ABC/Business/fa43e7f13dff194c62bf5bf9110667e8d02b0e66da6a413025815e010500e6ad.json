The USTR \"expects to proceed expeditiously thereafter,\" according to a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called the new U.S. tariff threat \"simply unacceptable,\" according to the Associated Press. \"It\u2019s not the behavior we expect from the United States toward one of its main allies,\u201d he added.\n\nLe Maire defended the digital tax as a way of forcing tech companies to pay their fair share of taxes instead of using countries as tax havens, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe French Association of Wine and Spirit Exporters called on \"urgent action\" by their government in response to the U.S. tariff threats in a tweet Tuesday.Taxe sur les services digitaux : suite aux nouvelles menaces \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8pesant sur la fili\u00e8re #Vin \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7, @FEVS_France demande une action urgente du Gouvernement @EmmanuelMacron @JBLemoyne @BrunoLeMaire @n_delattre @VerdierJouclas @PhilHoganEU @jwojc\nStock also fell Tuesday for French luxury goods brands LVMH and Hermes International in the wake of the news.\n"}
