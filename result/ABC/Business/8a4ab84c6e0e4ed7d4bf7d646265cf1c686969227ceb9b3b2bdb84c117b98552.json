It did not respond to an emailed request for comment Wednesday, but said in the settlement that it admits no wrongdoing and is settling to avoid expensive litigation.\nThe damages are to recover the higher costs paid by California state agencies, but Becerra noted that the parts makers also face class-action lawsuits on behalf of automobile dealers and buyers.\nA settlement website cited by Becerra,         http://www.autopartsclass.com/ , says auto buyers could each be eligible for $100 or more in restitution from those private class-action lawsuits, but must apply by year's end.\nThe state's settlements piggyback on a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice that began in 2010. Forty-two companies have pleaded guilty to federal price-fixing charges and agreed to pay nearly $3 billion in fines. DENSO, for instance, agreed to a $78 million federal fine in 2012.\nCalifornia was one of only two states to separately seek damages, along with Florida, which Becerra\u2019s office said helped support consumers\u2019 class-action lawsuits.
