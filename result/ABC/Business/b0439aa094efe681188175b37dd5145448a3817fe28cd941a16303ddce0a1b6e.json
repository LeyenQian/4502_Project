Trading is expected to happen on the Saudi Tadawul stock exchange on Dec. 11, or by mid-December.\nThe company is selling 0.5% to individual investors, who are Saudi citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia, and 1% to institutional investors, which can be sovereign wealth funds, asset managers and government-run pension programs.\nThe pricing of the shares is at the top range of what Aramco had sought. The company had priced it shares ranging from 30 to 32 riyals each, or between 8$ and $8.53 a share.\nIn the announcement Thursday, Aramco said the offering drew heavy demand. \nThe company's financial advisers had said earlier that most orders had come from Saudi funds or companies, with foreign investors\u2014 including from neighboring Gulf Arab states\u2014 accounting for 10.5% of the bids. It was not immediately known what the final figures released Thursday represent and how much of that was generated by foreign investment. \nThe highly anticipated sale of a sliver of the company has generated global buzz since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first announced plans for it more than two years ago. That\u2019s in part because it would clock in as the world\u2019s biggest IPO, surpassing record holder Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the Chinese conglomerate and e-commerce company, which raised about $25 billion in 2014.\nThe kingdom\u2019s plan to sell part of the company is part of a wider economic overhaul aimed at raising new streams of revenue for the oil-dependent country. This as oil prices struggle to reach the $75 to $80 per barrel price range that analysts say is needed to balance Saudi Arabia\u2019s budget. Brent crude is trading at just over $63 a barrel.\nPrince Mohammed has said listing Aramco is one way for the kingdom to raise capital for the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which would then use that money to develop new cities and lucrative projects across Saudi Arabia.\nDespite the mammoth figures involved in the IPO, they are not quite what the crown prince had envisioned based on the prince's own remarks over the past two years. He\u2019d previously talked about a valuation for Aramco of $2 trillion and a flotation of 5% of the company involving a listing on a foreign stock exchange. There are no immediate plans for an international listing.\nAramco said Thursday it would retain the option of an even bigger offering of a 3.45 billion share sale, representing $29.4 billion.\nDespite Aramco\u2019s profitability, the state\u2019s control of the company carries a number of risks for investors. Two key Aramco processing sites were targeted by drones and missiles in September, an attack that was claimed by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen but which the U.S. blamed on Iran. Iran denies the allegation.\nThe Saudi government also stipulates oil production levels, which directly impacts Aramco\u2019s output.\nOn Thursday, the countries that make up the OPEC oil-producing cartel \u2014 led by heavyweight Saudi Arabia\u2014 were meeting in Vienna to decide whether to cut down on their production and push up prices of fuel and energy around the world."}
