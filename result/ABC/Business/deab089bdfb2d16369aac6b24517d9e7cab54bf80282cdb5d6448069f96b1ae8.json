But         all the parties are nervous about the verdict of a volatile electorate fed up after years of Brexit wrangling.\nTruck driver Clive Jordan expressed a weariness that could be heard up and down the country during the five-week campaign.\n\u201cBasically I just want it over and done with now,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s doing what they said. Everybody\u2019s lying.\u201d \nBritain's first December vote since 1923 has been dubbed the Brexit Election. It is being held more than two years early in hopes of breaking Britain\u2019s political deadlock over the country\u2019s stalled departure from the European Union.\nJohnson has focused relentlessly on Brexit throughout the campaign, endlessly repeating his slogan \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d He says that if he wins a majority of the         650 House of Commons seats on Thursday, he will get Parliament to ratify his \u201coven-ready\u201d divorce deal with the EU and take Britain out of the bloc as scheduled on Jan. 31.\n\u201cIf we can get a working majority, we have a deal, it's ready to go,\u201d Johnson said Wednesday as he watched pies being baked at a catering firm in central England. \"We put it in, slam it in the oven, take it out and there it is -- get Brexit done.\"\nAs a slogan, \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d is both misleading and effective. If Britain leaves the EU on Jan. 31 it will only kick-start months or years of negotiations on future trade relations with the bloc, involving tough trade-offs between independence and access.\n\u201cHis campaign was all about \u2018Getting Brexit done,\u2019 but actually it\u2019s about getting Brexit started,\u201d said Tony Travers, professor of government at the London School of Economics. \u201cElections seem to suggest these things are easy; they\u2019re not.\u201d\nBut the notion of an end to the Brexit melodrama is tempting to voters who have watched politicians bicker for more than three years since Britain\u2019s June 2016 vote to leave the European Union.\n\u201cBrexit is fueling the election,\u201d said Allan Bailey, a parish councilor in Clowne, a former coal-mining village in the central England constituency of Bolsover. \u201cIf one person can offer this area ... Brexit, that person will win.\u201d\nThe Conservatives have focused much of their energy on trying to win seats like Bolsover \u2014 working-class towns in central and northern England that have elected Labour lawmakers for decades, but also voted strongly in 2016 to leave the EU.\nPolls suggest that plan may be working, and the Conservatives have also been helped by the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage, which decided at the last minute not to contest 317 Conservative-held seats to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote.\nLabour \u2014 which is largely but ambiguously pro-EU \u2014 faces competition for anti-Brexit voters from the centrist Liberal Democrats, Scottish and Welsh nationalist parties and the Greens.\n\u201cThe only reason the Conservatives are so far ahead in the polls now is that the \u2018remain\u2019 vote is divided,\u201d said Rosie Campbell, professor of politics at King\u2019s College London. \u201cFor \u2018remain\u2019 voters it has been a real failure of leadership.\u201d\nIf the Tories fail to win a majority, it will be a sign that voters think other issues are just as important as Brexit. Labour has focused on domestic issues, especially the wear and tear to the country\u2019s state-funded health service after nine years of Conservative government austerity. Labour also promises to boost public spending, nationalize Britain\u2019s railways and utilities and provide everyone in the country with free internet access \u2014 all paid for by raising taxes on high earners.\n\u201cMy message to all those voters who are still undecided is that you can vote for hope in this election,\u201d Corbyn said Wednesday at his final campaign rally.\nOn Brexit, Labour says it will negotiate a new divorce deal with the EU, then offer voters the choice in a new referendum between leaving on those terms and remaining in the bloc.\nFor many voters, Thursday's election offers an unpalatable choice. Both Johnson and Corbyn have personal approval ratings in negative territory, and both have been dogged by questions about their character.\nJohnson has been confronted with past broken promises, untruths and offensive statements, from calling the children of single mothers \u201cignorant, aggressive and illegitimate\u201d to comparing Muslim women who wear face-covering veils to \"letter boxes.\"\nCorbyn has been accused of allowing anti-Semitism to spread within the party. The 70-year-old left-winger is portrayed by opponents as an aging Marxist with unsavory past associations with Hamas and the IRA. \nThough the candidates claim to carry positive messages, the campaign has been littered with allegations of mudslinging and dishonesty \u2014 largely by the Conservatives. The Tories doctored a video of an interview with a senior Labour lawmaker to make it appear as if he had failed to answer a question, when he had. The party re-branded its press office Twitter account \u201cFactCheckUK\u201d during a television debate, earning a warning but no sanction from the social media site.\nJohnson combined an aggressive online campaign with a cautious approach to live appearances. He largely avoided tough interviews \u2014 to the fury of opponents \u2014 and had a generally gaffe-free election until the final days of the campaign. \nOn Monday, Johnson was caught making a ham-fisted and seemingly unsympathetic reaction to a picture of a 4-year-old boy lying on a hospital floor because no beds were available. Asked to look at the picture on a reporter\u2019s phone, Johnson grabbed the device and pocketed it.\nOn Tuesday, the father of a man killed in last month\u2019s knife attack near London Bridge accused the prime minister of using his son\u2019s death for political gain.\nIt's unclear how much those moments will influence the outcome when Britain\u2019s voters pass their verdict on Thursday. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. (0700GMT to 2200GMT), with most results expected early Friday.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press writers Danica Kirka and Jo Kearney in London and Alex Turnbull in Clowne, England, contributed to this report.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at         https://www.apnews.com/Brexit     "}
