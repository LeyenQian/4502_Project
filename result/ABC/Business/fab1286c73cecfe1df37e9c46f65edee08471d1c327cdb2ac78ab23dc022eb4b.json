Instead, the FAA and Boeing issued notices reminding pilots how to handle a nose-down pitch of their plane.\n\u201cObviously the result is not satisfactory,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cThe decision did not achieve the result that it needed to achieve.\u201d\nThe FAA concluded that more than 2,900 people could die in Max crashes over 45 years without the software fix. It assumed the fleet would eventually grow to 4,800 planes. Fewer than 400 were flying before they were grounded in March, after the second crash. And it estimated Boeing could fix MCAS software in about seven months.\nThe analysis was completed several weeks after the FAA had already issued the emergency notice to pilots \u2014 the agency took no additional steps after estimating 15 future crashes.\nAn FAA spokesman said the analysis is one of several tools the agency uses to analyze safety issues.\nA Boeing spokesman said the company's response to the first crash was \"fully consistent with the FAA's analysis and established process.\"\nDickson said that as Boeing seeks to return the Max to flying, his agency is controlling the process and won't delegate any of that authority to Boeing.\nDickson defended the safety record of U.S. aviation while saying \u201cwhat we have done in the past and what we are doing now will not be good enough in the future.\u201d\nA retired Boeing production manager told the lawmakers about \u201calarming\u201d conditions at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, where two Max planes that crashed were built. \nThe manager, Edward Pierson, said the assembly line fell far behind schedule by mid-2018 because of cascading problems that began with late delivery of key parts. There weren't enough mechanics and other workers, he said. Yet Boeing went ahead with its plan to boost production from 47 to 52 planes a month.\n\u201cBy June 2018, I had grown gravely concerned that Boeing was prioritizing production speed over quality and safety,\u201d Pierson said in prepared remarks. \u201cI witnessed a factory in chaos and reported serious concerns about production quality to senior Boeing leadership months before the first crash\u201d and again before the second crash.\nPierson said he told his bosses at Boeing that they should shut down the assembly line to deal with safety and quality-control issues, but no action was taken. Executives didn\u2019t mention the problems in financial reports.\nPierson, who retired last year, said he wrote to Dickson and other officials. He said he has been interviewed by the Justice Department \u2014 it is conducting a criminal investigation of Boeing \u2014 but the FAA never responded. Earl Lawrence, the FAA's executive director of aircraft certification, said the agency is investigating and has interviewed Renton production workers.\nBoeing hopes airlines will be able to use the plane again early next year after the company completes fixes to flight-control software and computers. Dickson has insisted that the FAA has no timetable for granting that approval. \nDeFazio praised Dickson's recent comments but was harshly critical of the agency and Boeing.\nThe FAA \u201cfailed to do its job. It failed to provide the regulatory oversight necessary to ensure the safety of the flying public,\u201d DeFazio said.\nPublished reports indicate that FAA officials knew very little about MCAS, which has been implicated in the October 2018 crash of a Max off the coast of Indonesia and the March 2019 crash of another Max in Ethiopia. In both crashes, investigators say, a faulty sensor caused MCAS to push the nose of the plane down and pilots were unable to regain control. In all, 346 people died.\nRegulators around the world grounded the plane after the second crash.\nSeveral relatives of passengers who died in the crashes attended Wednesday's hearing.\nDickson suggested that FAA will not delegate key review work to Boeing this time.\n\u201cThe FAA fully controls the approvals process for the flight control systems and is not delegating anything to Boeing,\" Dickson said in his written testimony. \u201cThe FAA will retain authority to issue airworthiness certificates and export certificates of airworthiness for all new 737 Max airplanes manufactured since the grounding.\u201d\nHe said the plane will only return to flying after all safety issues have been addressed and pilots have received enough training to fly the plane safely. \nDeFazio and other lawmakers have indicated they may offer legislation to overhaul the way the FAA certifies new aircraft. Dickson said that the FAA can do better, but the safety record of U.S. aviation \u2014 no deadly crashes of a U.S. airliner since 2009 \u2014 shows that the FAA's oversight is working.\n\u201cThe system is not broken,\u201d he said."}
