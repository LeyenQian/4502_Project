Separately, three people who worked at Fiat Chrysler have been convicted.\nAshton, 71, of Ocean View, New Jersey, appeared in Detroit federal court. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and faces roughly three years in prison when he's sentenced on March 3.\nAshton declined to comment. He awarded a $3.9 million contract from the UAW-GM training center for thousands of watches that remain in storage. The government said they were never given to union members.\n\u201cHe has asked me to apologize to all the members of the UAW. Good people make really bad decisions. ... He fully accepts responsibility,\" defense attorney Jerry Ballarotto told reporters.\nBallarotto said he'll offer an explanation \u2014 \u201cnot an excuse\" \u2014 at sentencing.\nIn a statement, the UAW said Ashton's crimes are \u201cagainst everything we stand for.\"\nWhile negotiating new contracts with GM, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler, the UAW has been in a crisis for months because of the corruption investigation.
