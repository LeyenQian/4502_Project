The franchisees must also notify current and former employees about the settlement and set up a $250,000 fund to handle future claims.\nThe workers were seeking a ruling that would consider McDonald's a \u201cjoint employer\u201d with its franchisees. That would have increased the company's liability and potentially have made it easier for McDonald's 850,000 U.S. workers to form a union. \nBut Chicago-based McDonald's insists it doesn't directly employ the workers. About 95% of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants are owned by franchisees. \nAn administrative law judge with the labor board rejected the proposed settlement in July 2018, saying it was unlikely to end the dispute and didn't require McDonald's to enforce the settlement. \nMcDonald's appealed to the full board, which agreed with the company. The case will now return to the administrative law judge, who has been directed by the board to approve the settlement."}
