Police fired tear gas Thursday morning at protesters in the western city of Nantes, and protesters set vehicles on fire in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille.\nUnions have flatly rejected fresh proposals by the government of President Emmanuel Macron to stagger the roll-out of the controversial plan that would require France's youngest workers to stay on the job two years longer, until the age of 64, to be eligible for a full pension.\n\u201cNo Christmas break unless the government comes to its senses,\u201d Laurent Brun of the General Work Confederation union warned Thursday. \nWorkers across many sectors are participating in the nationwide general strike, including teachers, doctors, nurses, railway personnel, actors and garbage collectors. \nThe National Syndicate of High School Teachers said it was \u201cstepping up\u201d its actions against reforms it branded \u201cunacceptable\u201d with fresh protests across major French cities Thursday. \nThe unions' quick dismissal of the proposal the government made Wednesday signals that labor leaders were serious when they billed the strikes as \u201cunlimited.\u201d \nThe strikes threaten to mirror similar ones in 1995 that lasted over three weeks, ended in the ouster of Prime Minister Alain Juppe and with proposed pension reforms being scrapped. The 1995 strikes were themselves compared in scale to the seismic events of May 1968, when France reached the brink of revolution.\nThough Parisians have been adversely affected since they rely the most on public transportation, other parts of France have experienced less aggravation and the striking workers have enjoyed widespread public support, according to polls. \nThe mood among the public remains strained but understanding. \n\u201cI totally understand why people are on strike... Obviously, everyone is affected by the pension reform,\" London-Paris commuter Nicolas Lipitei said Thursday.\n\u201c(But) I think there should be better provisions to accommodate getting to work. There\u2019s a huge impact on the economy, a huge impact to people,\u201d he added.\nMany French people and the unions leading the strikes fear the new system will force people to work longer for smaller pensions. \nThe government said the changes would ensure the pension system is \u201cfair and sustainable\" in the face of a growing population with a record number of people over age 90. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nNicolas Garriga contributed"}
