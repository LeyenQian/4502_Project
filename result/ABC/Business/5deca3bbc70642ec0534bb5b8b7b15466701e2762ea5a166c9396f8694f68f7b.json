The sad truth is, even working with other institutional investors throughout the country, engagement on this issue has not worked,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe cost, the economic cost, the social cost of gun violence is very, very significant. And the time is now because we don't have greater action in Washington on this issue.\u201d\nConnecticut pension funds are currently invested in five of 17 companies identified by an independent index as producers of guns and ammunition.\nThe proposal comes as the U.S. Supreme Court turns to gun rights for the first time in nearly a decade, hearing arguments Monday related to a dispute over now-defunct New York City restrictions on taking licensed, locked and unloaded guns outside city limits. The high court could sidestep the issue or possibly expand gun rights.\nWooden contends the intent of his plan, which was released first to The Associated Press, is not to put gun manufacturers out of business. The Democrat, who lost a cousin to gun violence, said he supports \u201cresponsible\u201d gun manufacturing and gun usage but argues that it is his job to reduce risk to the state\u2019s pension funds and that \u201cguns have been an incredibly risky proposition.\u201d\nLast month, the Connecticut State Supreme Court said a survivor and relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting could pursue their         lawsuit against Remington Arms, the maker of the rifle used by the shooter. The company has argued it should be shielded by a 2005 federal law preventing most lawsuits against firearms manufacturers when their products are used in crimes.\nWooden also hopes to influence the financial services and gun industries.\nHis plan would continue to allow state pension funds to be invested in companies involved in \u201csmart gun\u201d technology. It also would require banks and investment companies to describe their gun policies in any responses to requests for proposals from the Connecticut treasurer\u2019s office. Those policies will be considered, among other factors, when business is awarded.\nWooden announced Tuesday that Citigroup will be the senior underwriter on Connecticut\u2019s upcoming issuance of $890 million in general obligation bonds.\nUnder a 2018 policy, Citigroup is requiring its clients and business customers not to sell a firearm to anyone who hasn't passed a background check or anyone under age 21. It is also not allowing customers to sell what are known as bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.\nU.S. Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, sharply criticized Citigroup for the move at the time, accusing the bank of \u201cthreatening law-abiding business owners for exercising their Second Amendment rights.\u201d\nThe National Rifle Association has also accused \u201cAmerica\u2019s financial elite\u201d of wanting to \u201ccreate a world in which America\u2019s public policy decisions emanate from corporate boardrooms in Manhattan rather than from citizens and their elected officials.\u201d\nConnecticut is not alone in trying to use the power of the purse to influence the gun violence debate.\nIn 2018, the $222.5 billion California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System voted to use its financial might to pressure gun retailers to stop selling military-style assault weapons and accessories. Critics accused the board of setting a dangerous precedent."}
