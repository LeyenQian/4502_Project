Later, Agrofert again took ownership of the farm.\nAgrofert later returned the subsidy.\nIt is not immediately clear when the prosecution might finish the re-evaluation of the case.\nThe charges caused serious complications for Babis. After he won the 2017 parliamentary election, he faced a difficult task to form a government because other parties in Parliament were reluctant to enter a coalition with his centrist ANO movement.\nHe finally created a coalition with the leftist Social Democrats that has support from the Communists, a controversial move that gave the far-left party an indirect share of power for the first time since the anti-Communist 1989 Velvet Revolution.\nMassive street protests, unseen from 1989, against Babis took place in Prague and across the country earlier this year.\nSeparately, a European Union report in recent days concluded that Babis might have had a conflict of interest over EU subsidies involving his former business empire, according to local media.\nThe European Commission has not published the result of its audit because the procedure has not been completed.\nBabis again denies wrongdoing."}
