But only about 18% of the 1.2 million Americans who might benefit got a prescription last year, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said. And for those without insurance, the drugs can cost up to $2,000 a month.\nExpanding access to what\u2019s called PrEP \u2014 for pre-exposure prophylaxis \u2014 is one key to the Trump administration\u2019s ambitious goal of ending the nation\u2019s HIV epidemic by 2030.\n\u201cWe have the tools to stop the spread of HIV in its tracks. It\u2019s about execution,\u201d Azar told The Associated Press.\nThe HHS program is for the uninsured to seek free PrEP doses. Drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc. has         agreed to donate enough of its HIV prevention medicines for up to 200,000 people a year over 10 years.\nTo qualify, people must have a valid prescription and a negative HIV test and must lack prescription drug coverage. They can apply through a new website,         GetYourPrEP.com. Once approved, they'll be provided a card with a number necessary for their pharmacy to fill the prescription at no cost, officials said. \nThe uninsured aren\u2019t the only the concern. Even though most insurers cover PrEP, co-pays still can be obstacles, especially for people with high-deductible plans. \nGilead, based in Foster City, California, sells the only two brands of PrEP, Truvada and Descovy, approved in the U.S. A cheaper generic version of Truvada is expected next fall. \nGetting doctors to ask their patients about HIV risk factors and educating the public about PrEP also are hurdles. PrEP use has increased since 2016, when just 9% of those qualified got a prescription for HIV prevention, said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe increase is a good sign, but \u201cprogress is not fast enough,\u201d Mermin said.\nThere are about 38,000 new HIV infections in the U.S. each year. President Donald Trump's administration aims to reduce those by 75% in five years and by 90% in 10 years.\nAzar said the Gilead donation, first announced in May, wasn\u2019t affected by a patent-infringement lawsuit HHS recently filed against the company, arguing taxpayer-funded research helped lead to the recognition that certain drugs initially used to treat HIV also could prevent it.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York contributed to this report.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives         support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
